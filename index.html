Dan was the third and final member of Black Knights Inc. to accompany him on this mission. BKI being the covert government defense firm that operated under the guise of a custom motorcycle shop-okay, and sometimes Steady still had trouble believing such an entity actually existed; it was like something out of a bad spy novel.</p> <p>"S�," he admitted with an affectionate chuckle, smiling as Ozzie leaned over to whisper something into the shell of the agent's ear. The woman blushed and giggled, and Steady could only shake his head. "But the ladies never seem to mind. I don't know how he pulls it off time after time."</p> <p>"You don't?" Dan turned to lift a dubious brow as he took a leisurely sip of seltzer water. "I thought you two were neck and neck in that whole notches-on-the-bedpost race."</p> <p>Steady frowned at the bottle of Tiger beer in his hand. It was true. For a couple of years there, he'd given Ozzie a run for the money in the bedding of bar bunnies. But recently the...er...hunt had lost its allure.</p> <p>"I think I'm about done with all that, hermano. It just seems so..." He twisted his lips, searching for the word. "Superficial, I guess. Unfulfilling? I don't know." He shrugged. "And besides, I was never as good at it as Ozzie." He tipped his beer toward the table where the unrefuted king of casual relationships was now fiddling with the agent's fingers. Julia Ledbetter. That was her name. And she resembled a Secret Service agent about as much as a Chihuahua resembled a Doberman. But Steady supposed that was part of it. Protection through subterfuge and meek-but-mighty camouflage. Although, if you asked him, there was something to be said for the fierce, bulldog demeanor that good ol' Agent Mitchell had sported.</p> <p>He wondered what had happened to the guy. Come to think of it, he wondered what had happened to all the agents who'd been assigned to Abby's protection detail back in the day. There wasn't a familiar face among the seven in her current bunch.</p> <p>Then again, a lot could change in eight years. Just look at him. He'd gone from medical student to soldier to clandestine government operator in the space of that time. Hell, even his name was different...</p> <p>"Never as good as Ozzie?" Dan's second eyebrow joined his first somewhere near his hairline. "Well, I, uh..." He cleared his throat. "I hafta say, that's the first time I've ever heard a man admit his sexual prowess lacked in comparison to-"</p> <p>"That's not what I meant, pendejo. And you know it."</p> <p>Dan tucked his tongue in his cheek, nodding. "The beer bottle incident?"</p> <p>Steady fingered the small scar cutting through his scalp above his right ear. He'd received it courtesy of a one-night stand whom he'd thought understood the nature of their relationship. But when she caught him locking lips with a curvy little mamacita outside the back door of Red Delilah's Biker Bar-his local watering hole in Chicago where Black Knights Inc. was based-she'd shouted obscenities that questioned his mother's morals before hauling off and smashing a bottle of Bud over his head.</p> <p>"I told her I wasn't interested in anything serious," he said in his own defense. "I don't know how much more specific I could've been."</p> <p>"Mmm," Dan answered noncommittally, causing Steady's scowl to deepen. His entire life he'd been accused by family, friends, and teammates of being oblivious when it came to dishing out details, but he disagreed. He said what needed to be said when it needed to be said. He just wasn't all that elaborative, that's all.</p> <p>"Look," he continued, choosing to ignore Dan's non-answer and getting back to the point. "I'm only saying I might be ready for something...more." He blinked. A little astonished he'd climbed out on this conversational limb. After all, the Knights were a far cry from the touchy-feely sort. In fact, their discussions tended to center more on the latest weapons, motorcycle exhausts, and Chicago Cubs scores than anything that came close to resembling, you know, actual feelings.</p> <p>He waited for Dan to say something along the lines of whoa there, compadre, what are we? Girlfriends? So he was shocked when instead Dan went with, "Are you telling me you've sowed your last wild oat?"</p> <p>"I don't know about last." His frown kicked into a grin. "I'm not sure that's even possible. I'm Puerto Rican, man. My oats are endless."</p> <p>Dan rolled his eyes. "I can't believe that Latin lover shtick actually works."</p> <p>"What can I say? Chicks dig my Rico Suave."</p> <p>"Rico Suave?" Dan turned, cocking his head to study him. "Nah. I'd say you're more of a low-budget Enrique Iglesias."</p> <p>Steady punched him in the arm before quickly reining the conversation back in. Experience had taught him it was either that or devolve into a good, solid hour of swapping insults. Fun? Sure. But not at all productive. "The deal is, I'm thirty-three years old. And I can't help but wonder if it's time to start thinking about"-he made a rolling motion with his hand-"commitment."</p> <p>And would you look at that? He said the word without choking on it.</p> <p>Dan turned to face him, the picture of shock and awe. Seriously, George W. Bush would've been proud. "Well, well, well." He shook his sandy blond head. "Will wonders never cease?"</p> <p>"I know." Steady shrugged. "I'm a bit surprised myself. Or maybe I've been drinking too much of the Kool-Aid being served back home. I mean, you have noticed the rate at which our teammates are taking the plunge into happily-ever-after, haven't you?"</p> <p>"Staggering, isn't it?"</p> <p>In the last couple of years, six, count them, six of the BKI boys had strapped on the ol' ball and chain. And talk about wonders never ceasing? They actually made the condition look...well...good. Preferable even. God help me.</p> <p>"Or maybe this sudden attack of fidelity has something to do with the way you've been staring at"-Dan glanced around to make sure they were out of earshot of anyone who might be listening-"you know who for the last three days."</p> <p>The blood drained from Steady's head, leaving his face cold and his forehead clammy. "What do you mean?" he asked, shooting his cuffs and tilting his head from side to side in an attempt to loosen the tension that gripped his neck. Suddenly his clothes were too tight. He wanted to chalk it up to the fact that he was accustomed to wearing combat gear or jeans and a biker jacket. But deep down he knew the real reason his suit coat was now a straightjacket, his necktie a silk anaconda, was because Dan's assessment hit far too close to home. "How have I been staring at her?"</p> <p>"Like Winnie-the-Pooh stares at a pot of honey."</p> <p>"Pssht. You're imagining things. If I've been watching her, it's only because that's what we're being"-he lowered his voice to a whisper-"paid to do."</p> <p>"Yeah, but there's watching and then there's watching," Dan insisted.</p> <p>Steady squeezed the beer bottle so hard it was a wonder the thing didn't shatter. Dan was right. Since President Thompson had tasked him with flying to the other side of the globe to help protect Abby while she attended the New Frontiers in Horticulture Convention-s�, it was a thing. Who knew?-he hadn't been able to take his eyes off her. And although he hadn't seen or heard from her in eight years, she was just as he remembered...</p> <p>Slim, blond, pretty in an all-American kind of way, which seemed appropriate given she was the youngest daughter of the president of the United States. She still had those arresting green eyes that'd stopped him in his tracks when he met her on the Georgetown campus all those years ago. She still had that same sweet, luminous smile that'd fueled his fantasies back then and most of his daydreams since.</p> <p>She's too young for you, he remembered the scolding tone in Rosa's voice. And even if she isn't, she's too far out of your league. You think her father wants her dating a maldito bori when he's got a national election to win?</p> <p>He'd winced at the slur while at the same time knowing his sister was right. The difference between Abby's age and his had seemed insurmountable at the time. A gulf in life experience as wide and impassible as the vastness of space. But she was all grown up now, wasn't she? A woman, as in whoa-man. Everything guaranteed to rev his engine in one fair-haired little package.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that whole maldito bori thing hadn't changed. Even with his multiple degrees and that Army Ranger pin stuck to the lapel of the uniform hanging in his closet back home, he was still just the son of uneducated immigrants who'd spent their lives slinging cervezas and serving rice in a greasy corner caf� in Miami. And any illusions he'd had that Abby didn't care about such things was stripped from him the day of Rosa's funeral.</p> <p>He'd gone to her thinking maybe she would be his hand to hold, his shoulder to cry on. He'd gone to her thinking they were friends...maybe more than friends, though she had still been far too young for him. He'd needed her so badly that day he'd been willing to ignore the gap in their ages, the impropriety of his making a move, because his remorse, his grief, his need to comfort and be comforted had outweighed anything else. But he'd been wrong to think she might consider him worthy of her affection. She'd made it obvious that Rosa, and Rosa's position as her academic mentor, had been the only glue holding the three of them together.</p> <p>Abby may have exchanged her premed degree for one in botany, she may have traded in her scalpel for a garden spade, but like her appearance, nothing else about her was any different. She was still Abigail Thompson, the first daughter. America's princess. And he was still...well...him.</p> <p>"So, are you gonna let me in on the history between you two?" Dan asked when Steady had been quiet for too long.</p> <p>"No history," he quickly replied. At least none worth speaking of.</p> <p>"Yeah, I call bullshit."</p> <p>And now it was his turn to pull out the ol' Black Knights' tried-and-truism. "So, what if it is? You think I want to talk about it? What are we? Girlfriends?"</p> <p>Dan rolled his eyes. "Then you're happy we're headed out tomorrow? Happy to wave your good-byes to her?"</p> <p>And that thought made Steady's scalp itch. "I know I've said it a hundred times since we took this gig"-he kept his voice barely above a whisper-"but I don't buy that nonsense about Abby's big sister being the likely target of this prospective kidnapping just because she followed in her father's political footsteps to become a congresswoman." He used his thumb to pick at the beer's label, succeeding in peeling the corner away. He attacked the glue left behind with the blunt edge of his nail. "Being a government bigwig doesn't make Caroline any more attractive than Abby to those factions looking for leverage to use against the president."</p> <p>"Look, man, you read the NSA Intel the president gave us as closely as I did. All signs point to Caroline." Dan loosened his tie. They were here at the hotel under the guise of businessmen. Only the president, his JCs, and the Secret Service knew their real assignment-to provide auxiliary security for Abby when she wasn't safely ensconced in her room for the night. Like she was right now.</p> <p>And Dan was right, of course. All signs did point to Caroline. And since that was the case, President Thompson, who secretly ran Black Knights Inc. along with the Joint Chiefs, was only requiring Abby be given BKI protection when she was OCONUS-outside the contiguous U.S. Whereas Caroline had had a supplementary BKI force assigned to her every day of the last six weeks. Ever since the first peep of a possible kidnapping came over the wires.</p> <p>"Chin up." Dan elbowed him. "By oh-seven-hundred tomorrow morning we'll be hopping on a plane. And then none of this will be your problem. It'll be bye-bye bullet-catcher duty and bye-bye you know who."</p> <p>Bye-bye you know who? After eight long years apart, was he really ready to bid farewell to her again so soon? The answer to that question shouldn't make his heart ache. Mierda.</p> <p>He took a sip of beer, hoping the pain in his chest was simply indigestion brought on by the nasi kerabu he'd eaten for lunch-I mean, the blue rice should've been your first clue, pendejo. But the minute the suds touched his tongue, he grimaced. Plunking the beer on the bar, he scrubbed the back of his hand over his lips. "Madre de Dios," he grumbled. "Why can't they brew a decent beer on this side of the planet?" Dan's expression hardened when his eyes landed on the abandoned bottle. "Sorry." Steady winced. "I, uh, I guess any beer sounds good right about now, huh?"</p> <p>Dan "The Man" Currington had crawled into the bottle and stayed there for a full year after his wife was brutally gunned down inside the gates of the Black Knights' compound. It'd taken ninety days of rehab and a dogged mental fortitude Steady couldn't help but admire in order for Dan to pull himself back out.</p> <p>"It's not the taste that tempts me," Dan admitted, his tone stiff. "It's the oblivion it offers."</p> <p>Steady motioned for the bartender to come take the beer away. "And speaking of finding oblivion and sowing wild oats"-he tipped his chin toward the tall, lanky woman ordering a drink at the opposite end of the bar, happy to change the subject-"I can't help but notice how you and Agent DePaul have been making googly eyes at each other for the last seventy-two hours. Why don't you take a page from Ozzie's book and use the fact that you're both off the clock tonight to sow your wild oats. Seek oblivion in bed instead of the bottle. You know, get your freaky-deaky on."</p> <p>"Freaky-deaky?" Dan grunted. "Wow, Steady. Spoken like a true prodigy." But when he glanced toward Penni DePaul, the look he gave her exactly matched the one he'd given the beer only seconds ago. Two words: abject longing.</p> <p>In true BKI form, Steady called Dan on his bullshit. "It's obvious the woman puts you in a state of forlorn yearning, hermano. Like, seriously, I'm afraid if you don't do something about it soon, I'll find you locked in your room upstairs listening to Air Supply's greatest hits." Dan sent him a look meant to curdle his balls, and Steady shook his head, clapping a hand on the guy's shoulder. "Besides, Patti wouldn't want you to spend the rest of your life as a eunuch. She'd want you to be happy. She'd want-"</p> <p>"No." Dan shook his head. "It's too soon."</p> <p>"That's a pile of caca and you know it. It's been almost two years since Patti's accident." Dan opened his mouth, but Steady preempted him. "And don't give me that same old self-recriminating song and dance about it being your fault she's gone. You know as well as I do the only person to blame for what happened to Patti was the guy who pulled the trigger on that sawgun. It's time for you to move on. To start living again." ...</p></p><h2>Throbbing Gristle&#39;s Twenty Jazz Funk Greats (33 1/3)</h2><p>In 20 Jazz Funk Greats Drew Daniel (of the experimental band Matmos) creates-through both his own insights and exclusive interviews with the band-an exploded view of the album&#39;s multiple agendas: a series of close readings of each song, shot through with a sequence of thematic entries on key concepts, strategies, and contexts (noise, leisure, process, the abject, information, and repetition). This is a smart and unusual book about a pioneering band.</p><p><p>Drew Daniel is one half of the acclaimed electronic group Matmos - successful in their own right, and also as collaborators with Bjork. Drew has taught the history of electronic music at the San Francisco Art Institute and a sound art seminar at Harvard. He has just moved to Baltimore, where he now teaches in the English Department at Johns Hopkins University.</p>&#x201c;Daniel writes evocatively of his own experience with <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, which he discovered as an adolescent looking for more extreme forms of music, but the best passages in the book are his Q&amp;A's with the band members, who remain as confrontational and confounding as ever.&#x201d; &#x2015;Stephen M.

What emerges is a persuasive argument for the many ways that African American culture <i>is </i>American culture, and for the centrality of art&#x2015;and artfulness&#x2015;to our daily life.

Built at the peak of the race between the British, French and Germans to build bigger and better ships, she was the achievement of 15,000 men in one of the world&#x2019;s most advanced shipyards. While everyone knows the new White Star liner was the most glamorous and was full of millionaires when she sank, few appreciate just how luxurious she was or how advanced her design was for her day.For the first time, Bruce Beveridge, Scott Andrews, Steve Hall, Daniel Klistorner and Art Braunschweiger look in detail at the ship herself, how she was built and what it was like inside. From the engine rooms to the First Class parlour suites, from the Doulton water closets to the cargo cranes, every area of Titanic is presented in stunning detail.Volume One covers the design and construction of Titanic, with individual chapters detailing such diverse areas as the riveting of the ship, her heating and ventilation systems, funnels, steering and navigation systems and more. Volume Two covers the interior design and fitting out of the ship and presents detailed deck-by-deck information, from the palatial rooms of First Class to areas of the ship seen only by the crew.</p><p>BRUCE BEVERIDGE (US) has been a historian for many years, centering on early civilizations, the Crusades, and famous ships. He is also the senior historical archivist for his local community library and spends his time away from Titanic working on local history projects. Bruce is one of the foremost visual and technical historians of the Olympic class ships and has advised on Titanic&#x2019;s specifications for exhibitions, publishing companies, professional modeling firms, the Danbury Mint, museums, television production companies, the auction firm of Henry Aldridge &amp; Son and other organizations. Bruce&#x2019;s highly sought-after General Arrangement plan of the ship, released in 2003, is the most highly detailed and accurate plan released to date and has subsequently been used by dive teams investigating the wreck. He co-authored Titanic or Olympic &#x2013; The Truth Behind the Conspiracy in 2004, Titanic in Photographs and the Report into the Loss of the SS Titanic: A Centennial Reappraisal in 2011.SCOTT ANDREWS (US) first became aware of the story of Titanic at the age of four when he was captivated by a picture of the ship published in Reader&#x2019;s Digest as part of a condensed version of Walter Lord&#x2019;s A Night to Remember. Between having it read to him and then seeing the J. Arthur Rank movie of the same name, he admits he became thoroughly and hopelessly hooked. Scott&#x2019;s primary interest in Titanic centres on the engineering aspects of the ship &#x2013; her design, construction and propulsion machinery. He is a trustee of the Titanic Research and Modeling Association, and also co-authored Titanic in Photographs. His interests outside Titanic include pipe organs and organ building and restoring antique cars.STEVE HALL lives in the small coastal town of Angels Beach in New South Wales, Australia. He is a renowned Titanic visual historian, having collected, studied and researched the ship&#x2019;s photographic record for over three decades. He has consulted to the media, auction houses and museums around the world and holds one of the largest private collections of Titanic photographs in the world. He has co-authored several landmark books on the subject, including Titanic or Olympic &#x2013; The Truth Behind the Conspiracy (2004), Titanic in Photographs (2011) and Report into the Loss of the SS Titanic: A Centennial Reappraisal (2011). He retired from the information technology industry several years ago and devotes his spare time toward writing a series of children&#x2019;s novels.DANIEL KLISTORNER developed an interest in Titanic during the early 1990s after reading a newspaper article about an expedition to the wreck. Daniel&#x2019;s interest in Titanic centres around passengers and accommodations. His research of exacting details has been the key to his comprehensive understanding of Titanic&#x2019;s passenger areas, interiors and fittings as well and he is a recognised authority in this area, particularly the first class staterooms and their styles of design. He has provided consultation for several authors and auction houses as well as Bruce Beveridge&#x2019;s General Arrangement plans of the ship, and is a co-author of Titanic in Photographs. Daniel resides in Sydney, Australia, and is an avid traveller.ART BRAUNSCHWEIGER has had a long-standing interest in maritime and naval history, focusing on the British Navy of the period 1750&#x2013;1820, Second World War submarine warfare in the Pacific, the Atlantic convoys of the Second World War and, of course, Titanic. He has consulted for TIME-LIFE books on Titanic and has authored several research articles in print and online. Art also co-authored Titanic in Photographs and the 2012 rewrite of Titanic or Olympic &#x2013; Which Ship Sank? Art is an experienced wreck diver and devotes his spare time to model ship building and beekeeping. He lives in Bridgewater, New Jersey, with his wife and two Labrador Retrievers.</p><h2>Wine Isn&#39;t Rocket Science: A Quick and Easy Guide to Understanding, Buying, Tasting, and Pairing Every Type of Wine</h2><p>Rocket science is complicated, wine doesn't have to be!

Generally, children do not develop the motor skills necessary to speak until they are two, and yet they are able to communicate using sign language as early as six months. Written by an experienced signer and a mother of three, this illustrated step-by-step guide will allow readers to join the ranks of parents around the world who experience the rich rewards of communicating with their preverbal babies by using sign language. <br><br> Studies have shown that babies who are taught to use signs to express themselves before they can actually speak are more contented because they can communicate their basic needs (and ideas!) and also are more skilled at speaking once they begin to acquire language. Full of practical tips, real anecdotes, and straightforward diagrams of more than sixty basic American Sign Language signs, <i>Baby Talk</i> is the essential baby-signing handbook for parents, relatives, and caregivers-and their babies, who are just a little too young to express themselves verbally.</p><p>Monica Beyer, creator of the highly trafficked website signingbaby.com, gained firsthand knowledge of the benefits of using baby sign language from teaching her own three children.

It seems now that every phenomenon is universal, happening simultaneously worldwide, making the term &#34;global village&#34; quite accurate. World news keeps us informed about what is happening on the other side of the earth, and the internet links us together, however separate we may be geographically. So it might sound ironic that nationality has gained all the more value in these times, but it is true. Because there remains nothing else to make ourselves unique but what we preserve from time unknown. Korea has suffered many vicissitudes. Everyone knows that. She was destroyed almost to ashes. It was not a far cry to guess once that she had no future indeed. But she came to her feet again, and after that has not ever looked back. Korea now is one of the most industrialized countries, with its capital city, Seoul, one of the largest and most crowded megalopolises in the world. But it would be wrong to think that Korea has lost everything traditional, its legacy and heritage, during her colonial era, war, and industrialization, because much remains. Korea is a beautiful country. The natural environment is beautiful and so are the people who work hard and make their lives here. The traces of the ancestors who made this land their home such a long time ago have not disappeared; the link remains strong as their descendents continue to live on the same land today using one common language, finding pride and dignity in the continuation of their history and culture. The Beauty of Korea contains the beauty which could be found nowhere but in Korea through the marvelous works of photographer Suh Jai-sik who has an established reputation by his works for Korea&#39;s only multilingual pictorial magazine SEOUL.</p><p></p><h2>Midwifing Death: Returning to the Arms of the Ancient Mother</h2><p>"Because it rejects the cycle of life and death, violence and the threat of death have become the dominant grammar of international political relations.

Torres lives in Monroe, CT..CHAPTER&nbsp;1<br><br>A BRIEF HISTORY of CHICKENS<br><br>It probably comes as no surprise to hear that chickens came here shortly after the arrival of the first English settlers at Jamestown. And much has changed with chickens and the business of chickens over a few hundred years.<br><br>E ven then, chickens were more of a sideline than a business or vocation. They weren't exactly regarded as farm animals&#x2014;not in the same way cattle or horses were. Unlike those animals, chickens took up little space and required minimal care. Chickens were kept in small flocks, so it was usually very much a family affair. For instance, it was traditionally the job of the youngest child to gather the daily eggs, and, for the most part, the family chickens were managed by mom rather than dad. Extra eggs were sold at the market for "egg money," a little supplemental income for mom, in addition to the fresh eggs provided for the family.<br><br>In America, chickens were historically more of a hobby&#x2014;and they were a very American hobby, at that. For example, Thomas Jefferson gifted his favorite granddaughter with a pair of bantams for her pleasure. Teddy Roosevelt owned a one-legged rooster, and his children had pet hens with names like Fierce and Baron Spreckle. It's only been recently that chickens have gotten a bad reputation. Among some people, they are regarded as dumb or dirty birds. However, nothing could be further from the truth, though it's not hard to figure out where these erroneous ideas came from if you look at the conditions in factory farms today. Certainly, if it were permissible to keep dogs or cats (or any animal) in similar conditions, our ideas of their intelligence and cleanliness would be different as well.<br><br>But the reputation of chickens was once quite different&#x2014;in the past, they were symbols of goodness and bravery. In medieval times, for instance, the call of a rooster was thought to drive away demons and devils. Chickens have been variously considered symbols of pride, fertility, and even enlightenment, being heralds of the dawn. Roosters faithfully announced the break of day, so sunlight would illuminate the world and send evil and darkness slipping off into the shadows. A rooster was the model of an excellent father and, in fact, a symbol of fatherhood: He was vigilant in protection of his family, genteel in demeanor, and a generous provider. After all, when a rooster finds a choice morsel of food, he calls his family to the feast, letting the hens eat first while he watches for danger and keeps the peace. Roosters are even graceful dancers; consider the elegant sweep of a rooster's extended wing as he moves in circles around a hen he's trying to charm.<br><br>It wasn't only roosters that were esteemed, though. Hens were also admired&#x2014;symbolic of courage, self-sacrifice, and domestic virtue. Jesus compared himself gathering the tribes of Israel to a mother hen gathering chicks under her wings. Hens sit faithfully for weeks on the nest to hatch their eggs, barely eating or drinking until their little chicks have emerged. Then, there are 5 to 6 weeks more of care until the young birds are ready to be on their own. For good reason, hens were regarded as faithful, protective mothers&#x2014;the epitome of tenderness and motherly love. In fact, the Greek historian Plutarch described the hen in this way: "What of the hens whom we observe each day at home, with what care and assiduity they govern and guard their chicks? Some let down their wings for the chicks to come under; others arch their backs for them to climb upon. There is no part of their bodies with which they do not wish to cherish their chicks if they can, nor do they do this without a joy and alacrity which they seem to exhibit by the sound of their voices."<br><br>A 1933 snapshot shows a group of young women with their chickens.<br><br>Even chicken eggs were symbols of rebirth and the cycle of life. In many cultures they were decorated in the springtime, joyously sought and found, a herald also of the returning plenty that came with the change of seasons. People have been delighting in chickens for thousands of years.<br><br>For early American settlers, chickens were a great family hobby. You didn't have to live on a farm to keep chickens. Cows, horses, goats, and other livestock required large amounts of open pasture and a lot of work and expense. By contrast, chickens could live in a small yard. They cost little, and they required little effort. They would eat grains dropped by other animals or scraps from the kitchen, so they reduced waste. They even cut down on the insect population in their immediate vicinity with their sharp-eyed bug hunting. They were self-sufficient to a large extent, and often&#x2014;although we don't recommend this today&#x2014;the family chickens weren't even provided with a coop or other housing (like a barn). They simply roosted in trees or wherever they could, left to avoid predators on their own&#x2014;or not.<br><br>That's how it was for chickens in the early years of the United States.<br><br>THE CHICKEN CRAZE BEGINS<br><br>In the early to mid-1800s, for the first time, a breed of chickens known as Cochins was imported from China, and these appealing, fat, fluffy balls of feathers created a sensation. Compared to the flighty, quick birds most families kept for eggs, Cochins seemed as docile as kittens, and they were beautiful, too, with elaborately feathered legs and silver-laced, blue, and mottled colors. They made exceptional mothers that were also calm and easy to handle, so the chicks they raised were often especially docile, too.<br><br>In short order, everyone wanted Cochins. But Cochins couldn't really be kept in the same catch-as-catch-can way that other chickens were being kept at the time. For one thing, their ponderous size made it improbable, if not impossible, for them to be able to roost high up in trees and nimbly avoid predators on their own. For another, their profusely feathered legs could be problematic in muddy environments. And lastly, they were expensive in comparison to other chickens, so there was more of a desire to provide housing and security for the rare, new China Cochins.<br><br>As the first real exhibition chickens in the United States, Cochins set off a craze for poultry exhibition that has continued to this day. Professional farmers began getting involved with chickens, using selective breeding to create chickens with fancy feathering: crests, beards, feathered legs, and unusual plumage. However, chickens bred in this way didn't necessarily breed true; offspring might be completely different in character from their parents. With no breeding standards, there could be no real breeds like there are today. Establishing a new breed is a complex process. Once you have produced a stable cross, other breeders must show interest and standards (what the bird should look like) must be agreed on. In the early 19th century, those standards did not exist yet.<br><br>THE MODERN CHICKEN<br><br>The advent of modern poultry keeping resulted from a few different things happening at once, most notably the creation of the American Poultry Association (APA) in 1873. The APA began standardizing breeds, so that to be called a "breed," a chicken would have to be able to produce the same type of bird in future generations. This meant that someone buying chickens could be reasonably assured of the type of chickens he'd see in future generations, and could choose breeds based on qualities needed, such as cold hardiness, productivity, or early maturity. This was also the year that the first artificial incubator was patented&#x2014;so chicks could now be hatched in quantity.<br><br>Once there were standard breeds as well as a way to produce chickens in quantity, the chicken world was transformed. More people had access to keeping chickens, since hatching chicks no longer relied so much on Mother Nature. You didn't need broody hens to hatch eggs (broodiness could even be bred out, if desired). These changes also made it possible for chicken and egg businesses to grow substantially. Today, a single commercial incubator can hatch many thousands of chicks--a vast difference from the measly dozen or so eggs at a time a broody hen can hatch.<br><br>Other changes followed soon after: Mass transportation allowed baby chicks to be shipped by train as early as the 1890s, and hatcheries began springing up all over the country. Farmers could order chickens "designed" to mature quickly and lay lots of eggs, and hobbyists could branch out into rare and fancy breeds they'd been coveting for years simply because there was better access to them. But while improved transportation helped the hobby, it also enabled chicken keeping to take its first steps toward becoming a large-scale agribusiness.<br><br>Egg businesses were now able to order hundreds and thousands of baby chicks. And because of this, the birds began to be kept in different conditions. After all, when you have a flock of hundreds or thousands rather than just 20 or 30, your chickens will need much more space than what had been dedicated to small hobby flocks to allow them to forage enough to sustain themselves. And since the leftover table scraps of a family of four (or six or 10) wouldn't do much to supplement the foraging of that many birds, commercial chicken feed was developed, and it was formulated to keep chickens well nourished and maximize the number of eggs they could lay. Around the turn of the 20th century, chickens laid only about 30 eggs per year. Now, good layers are expected to produce around 200 to 250 eggs per year&#x2014;seven to eight times as many. The selective breeding and the improved nutrition are paying off.<br><br>The Downside of Modern Methods<br><br>To remain competitive, egg farms had to become very efficient, so they changed their management practices: Confinement became the norm as producers began to realize savings from it. Confining chickens required less space, and it meant that they were in less danger from predators and eggs could be more easily gathered. Eggs were so cheap at the grocery store that fewer people kept their own chickens for eggs, and the space factory farms allocated to their birds grew smaller and smaller.<br><br>Since chickens don't naturally live in close quarters, confinement created new problems, from aggression to increased risk of disease. Commercial chicken feed had started out by providing much-needed balanced nutrition for flocks that were confined away from natural forage; however, the focus of factory farming operations came to be on the quantity of eggs produced, rather than on the quality.<br><br>Stress made the huge flocks vulnerable to many illnesses, and the density of their living spaces made it easy for sick birds to pass those illnesses to other birds. Bored birds would pick on each other ruthlessly from the stress of living in cages or cramped quarters their entire lives. Birds at the bottom of the pecking order couldn't get away from more aggressive hens like they could if allowed to roam free, and aggression became a serious problem. Rather than make the determination that chickens need a certain minimum amount of space for their physical and mental well-being, research went in the other direction: How can we squeeze more chickens into smaller spaces? But overcrowding causes stress, which in turn causes aggression among chickens.<br><br>Today, the most common "solution" for the stress and aggression caused by close confinement in large factory farms is to debeak young chicks, a painful process often referred to with the less horrifying term beak trimming.<br><br>As someone interested in backyard chicken keeping, you probably don't need to hear from us about the awful conditions chickens endure in many big commercial farming operations. You'll want to raise your chickens in humane, healthy conditions. And you will have the chance to discover how smart and endearing they really are. Fortunately, some progress, however modest, has been made in chicken farming. The European Union Council Directive has banned wire battery cages in the European Union. California has taken some steps as well, due to consumer outrage. However, some other states are taking steps backward, and animal abuse continues in factory farms. Your chickens will have a much better life.<br><br>Egg-cetera!<br><br>In most breeds, juvenile roosters can be distinguished from juvenile hens by the shape of their hackle and saddle feathers. Hens have rounded feathers, while roosters have long, pointy feathers in comparison.<br><br>Restoring Common Sense<br><br>The best solution to the aggression caused by close confinement is pretty simple: Give chickens more space and allow them to behave like chickens, rather than treating them like egg-making machines. When you keep a backyard flock, you have control over how the birds are kept and what they're eating. And by raising chickens that produce eggs in your own backyard, you're also reducing demand for inhumanely produced factory farm eggs, not to mention that you have more control over what you are feeding your family.<br><br>Not coincidentally, giving chickens room and access to pasture increases the healthfulness of their eggs, on top of all the other benefits. Mother Earth News studies in 2007 and 2010 concluded that eggs from chickens raised on pasture are higher in omega-3s; vitamins A, D, and E; and beta- carotene while being lower in cholesterol and saturated fat. Really, this is what the new backyard chicken movement is all about.</p><h2>Martin Luther King: The Essential Box Set: The Landmark Speeches and Sermons of Martin Luther King, Jr.</h2><p>For the first time ever, twenty-four original recordings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., from his iconic "I Have A Dream" speech to his stirring sermon "A Knock At Midnight," are collected together in this treasured box set.

We want as much as we can get, and we deploy instrumental reasoning&#x2015;cost-benefit analysis&#x2015;to get it. We judge ourselves and others by how well we succeed. It is a way of life and thought that seems natural, inevitable, and inescapable. As David Wootton shows, it is anything but. In <i>Power, Pleasure, and Profit</i>, he traces an intellectual and cultural revolution that replaced the older systems of Aristotelian ethics and Christian morality with the iron cage of instrumental reasoning that now gives shape and purpose to our lives.</p><p>Wootton guides us through four centuries of Western thought&#x2015;from Machiavelli to Madison&#x2015;to show how new ideas about politics, ethics, and economics stepped into a gap opened up by religious conflict and the Scientific Revolution. As ideas about godliness and Aristotelian virtue faded, theories about the rational pursuit of power, pleasure, and profit moved to the fore in the work of writers both obscure and as famous as Hobbes, Locke, and Adam Smith. The new instrumental reasoning cut through old codes of status and rank, enabling the emergence of movements for liberty and equality. But it also helped to create a world in which virtue, honor, shame, and guilt count for almost nothing, and what matters is success.</p><p>Is our world better for the rise of instrumental reasoning? To answer that question, Wootton writes, we must first recognize that we live in its grip.</p></p><p>David Wootton is Anniversary Professor of History at the University of York.

He stayed to cover the jihadis&#x2019; last great stand, the Battle of Mosul, not knowing it would go on for nearly a year, nor that it would become, in the words of the Pentagon, "the most significant urban combat since WWII."</p><p><em>They Will Have to Die Now</em> takes the reader into the heart of the conflict against the most lethal insurgency of our time. We see unspeakable violence, improbable humanity, and occasional humor. We meet an Iraqi major fighting his way through the city with a bad leg; a general who taunts snipers; an American sergeant who removes his glass eye to unnerve his troops; a pair of Moslawi brothers who welcomed the Islamic State, believing, as so many Moslawis did, that it might improve their shattered lives. Verini also relates the rich history of Iraq, and of Mosul, one of the most beguiling cities in the Middle East.</p></p><p>James Verini is a Contributing Writer at the New York Times Magazine and National Geographic. He has also written for The New Yorker, The Atavist, and other publications, and has won a National Magazine Award and a George Polk Award.&#x201c;<em>They Will Have to Die Now</em> is the story of what happened after most Americans stopped paying attention to Iraq. It&#x2019;s a small miracle that a writer as good as James Verini witnessed the battle of Mosul. His book is erudite, humane, bleakly funny, and unbearably sad. It will take its place among the very best war writing of the past two decades.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Packer, author of <em>Our Man</em> and <em>The Assassins&#x2019; Gate</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Verini&#x2019;s firsthand account of the Battle of Mosul is a thing of terrible beauty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jonathan Franzen</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>They Will Have to Die Now</em> is a vivid, captivating, compelling, and graphic account of the major battle against the Islamic State in Iraq, the Battle for Mosul...James Verini conveys brilliantly the often tragic ancient and modern history of Iraq, and he captures superbly the brutal reality of one of the most intense urban battles since WWII. In so doing, he describes the terrible hardships experienced by the Moslawis and both the worst and the best of mankind in war.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gen. David Petraeus (US Army, Ret.) former commander of the Surge in Iraq, US Central Command, and Coalition Forces in Afghanistan, and former director of the CIA</strong><br><br>&#x201c;James Verini&#x2019;s book stands comparison with the pathbreaking works of modern war journalism that meld into great literature. One has to go back to the Vietnam War and Michel Herr&#x2019;s <em>Dispatches</em> to find such a vivid, poignant, and historically grounded narrative of an appalling war; a war caused no little by the misdeeds, missteps, and malevolence of the myriad powers and forces that have tried to dominate the Middle East.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ali Allawi, former minister of finance, defense, and trade of Iraq</strong><br><br>&#x201c;With the eye of a novelist and a historian&#x2019;s sweep, James Verini tells a moving, gripping, complexly layered story of Mosul, from the private calamities of its present to the buried dynasties of its past.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Larissa MacFarquhar, author of <em>Strangers Drowning</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is a stunning book, brave in its reporting and beautiful in its writing. It is funny and sad and seared into me, and I can&#x2019;t recommend it highly enough, not just to people interested in the truth of a war but to anyone in search of the truth of humanity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Finkel, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning reporter at the <em>Washington Post</em> and author of <em>The Good Soldiers</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is such an important and deeply nuanced book. Verini paints absolutely convincing portraits of the Iraqi soldiers trying to take their broken country back, and in humanizing them, he joins the ranks of Liebling and Pyle and Gellhorn&#x2015;American journalists able to embed so selflessly with soldiers, to listen first and theorize rarely, to tell a story as it happened. He does us and the Iraqis trying to rebuild, after decades of catastrophic war, a service.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dave Eggers, best-selling author of <em>Zeitoun</em>, <em>A Hologram for the King</em>, and <em>The Circle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tough, smart, and vivid, this is a book that renders war and battle with the deft hand of a fine writer.

In the second volume of a monumental trilogy, Allan R. Millett now shifts his focus to the twelve-month period from North Korea's invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950, through the end of June 1951&#x2014;the most active phase of the internationalized "Korean War." <br><br>Moving deftly between the battlefield and the halls of power, Millett weaves together military operations and tactics without losing sight of Cold War geopolitics, strategy, and civil-military relations. Filled with new insights on the conflict, his book is the first to give combined arms its due, looking at the contributions and challenges of integrating naval and air power with the ground forces of United Nations Command and showing the importance of Korean support services. He also provides the most complete, and sympathetic, account of the role of South Korea's armed forces, drawing heavily on ROK and Korea Military Advisory Group sources. <br><br>Millett integrates non-American perspectives into the narrative&#x2014;especially those of Mao Zedong, Chinese military commander Peng Dehuai, Josef Stalin, Kim Il-sung, and Syngman Rhee. And he portrays Walton Walker and Matthew Ridgway as the heroes of Korea, both of whom had a more profound understanding of the situation than Douglas MacArthur, whose greatest flaw was not his politics but his strategic and operational incompetence. <br><br>Researched in South Korean, Chinese, and Soviet as well as American and UN sources, Millett has exploited previously ignored or neglected oral history collections-including interviews with American and South Korean officers&#x2014;and has made extensive use of reports based on interrogations of North Korean and Chinese POWs. The end result is masterful work that provides both a gripping narrative and a greater understanding of this key conflict in international and American history.</p><p>"An extraordinarily thoughtful, provocative, and detailed narrative of how the conflict on the peninsula evolved from a 'local war' into a major military confrontation between the United States and Communist China, and how it remained a 'limited war.' It further confirms Millett's position as the world's leading scholar of military history in general and the Korean War history in particular."--Chen Jian, author of <i>China's Road to the Korean War</i><p> </p><p>"Millett's gripping story vividly captures the most dynamic period of the war. . . .

With this reissue of North American Canoe Country, a new generation of readers has the chance to learn time-tested secrets of a safe canoe adventure from a master outdoorsman.<p>First published in 1964, North American Canoe Country is a complete treatise on the art of canoeing. Written as a guide for travelers who wanted to embark on self-sufficient trips deep into the wilderness, this book offers readers all the information they need to plan and undertake a canoe trip. Rutstrum gives the essentials on canoes, comparing birch-bark, wood, wood-and-canvas, and aluminum crafts. His paddling procedures are timeless -- he describes strategies for rough waters, rapids, for boating alone or in tandem, including diagrams of strokes. Portaging, safety procedures, direction finding, towing, and much more are systematically approached and explained.</p><p>Rutstrum also writes about some of the epic canoe journeys of the twentieth century. This book will be of interest to both armchair adventurers curious about life in the great American wilderness and to those who want ideas on how to return to a less complicated way of enjoying the great outdoors.</p></p><p>Rutstrum was one of the best-known outdoorsmen of his generation.</p><h2>The Lucky Ones</h2><p><p>A young pregnant mother wrestles with an utterly changed life; a new father searches for a sign of the man he used to be; a daughter yearns for a lost childhood; and a mother reaches out in bewilderment to a child she can't fully understand. A rare novel that illuminates "the bustling concourses of life" without sacrificing emotional depth and complexity, <i>The Lucky Ones</i> confirms Rachel Cusk's place among our most incisive writers.</p></p><p><p><strong>Rachel Cusk</strong> is the author of the critically acclaimed trilogy of <em>Outline, Transit </em>and <em>Kudos</em>. She has written three memoirs&#x2014;<em>A Life&#x2019;s Work, The Last Supper</em> and <em>Aftermath</em>&#x2014;and several novels: <em>Saving Agnes</em>, winner of the Whitbread First Novel Award;<em> The Temporary</em>; <em>The Country Life</em>, which won a Somerset Maugham Award; <em>The Lucky Ones</em>; <em>In the Fold</em>; <em>Arlington Park</em>; and <em>The Bradshaw Variations</em>. Cusk was twice a finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and shortlisted for the Governor General&#x2019;s Award. She was chosen as one of <em>Granta</em>&#x2019;s 2003 Best of Young British Novelists. She lives in London.</p>Billed as a novel of "overlapping relationships," Whitbread-winner Cusk's evocative latest, with its tenuously connected sections, feels more like a short story collection linked by theme and a few shared characters. Cusk (The Country Life; Saving Agnes) unites her tales via her characters' lonely, isolated conditions and the knotty relationships between parents and children&#x2014;from Kristy, an imprisoned mother-to-be who gives birth in the back of a squad car in "Confinement," to Mrs. Daley, an unhappy, controlling woman whose need to establish herself as a victim trumps her ability to find or give happiness in "Mrs Daley's Daughter." Cusk's vision of contemporary relationships is a lonely, wintry one, in which people's inner landscapes dominate. This makes for gorgeous, languorous writing in places, but it also restricts the view: the landscapes are so rich with pathos that there isn't always enough room for the range of human emotion so essential to prose that relies on thought instead of action. In "The Sacrifices," a married woman who never had the baby she desired visits her childhood home, now occupied by strangers, and fantasizes about returning to her old room: "I would sit on my bed as the afternoon turned outside the window to night. I would wait for them to call me down." This passivity runs throughout the book, as characters tend toward rumination rather than deed. But as readers come to the end, the lives of Cusk's characters begin to tie together hauntingly. This is not life in all its messy complexity, but a mannered, poignant portrait of the treacheries of domestic life. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many of them (8 percent of men and 20 percent of women) may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--a life-altering anxiety disorder. Once connected mainly with veterans of war, PTSD is now being diagnosed in many situations that cause extreme trauma such as rape, physical attacks or abuse, accidents, terrorist incidents, or natural disasters. The millions of family members of those who have PTSD also suffer, not knowing how to help their loved one recover from the pain.Shock Waves is a practical, user-friendly guide for those who love someone suffering from this often debilitating anxiety disorder, whether that person is a survivor of war or of another harrowing situation or event. Through her own experience, extensive research, advice from mental health professionals, and interviews with those working through PTSD and their families, Cynthia Orange shows readers how to identify what PTSD symptoms look like in real life, respond to substance abuse and other co-occurring disorders, manage their reactions to a loved one's violence and rage, find effective professional help, and prevent their children from experiencing secondary trauma.Each section of Shock Waves includes questions and exercises to help readers incorporate the book's lessons into their daily lives and interactions with their traumatized loved ones</p><p>Cynthia Orange has written extensively about addiction and recovery, parenting, and post-traumatic stress disorder. She co-facilitates a caregivers&#39; support group, and she and her husband (a Vietnam combat veteran) often speak to audiences about the effects of trauma and war in their continuing involvement with veterans and veterans&#39; issues. She is an award-winning writer who has published hundreds of articles, columns, and guest editorials in newspapers, magazines, and literary journals. She is the author of several books, and contributed to the popular meditation book Today&#39;s Gift.Orange resides in West St. Paul, Minnesota.Of those affected by trauma, research shows that 8% of men and 20% of women could develop post-traumatic stress disorder. Orange (Sing Your Own Song) has personal experience with her topic; her husband, a Vietnam veteran, was diagnosed with PTSD after its symptoms had impacted their lives for years. Using contributor stories, the author illustrates the varied paths PTSD can take and guides readers through the journey to recovery, "a life-long process that improves all aspects of ourselves: body, mind, and spirit." Orange believes that choice plays a major role in recovery. "Each day we can decide to blame trauma or our loved one for our actions and feelings or we can take responsibility for our own life and growth." Ways of diagnosing PTSD and information on the warning signs of suicide, trauma responses, and the affect of trauma on loved ones are also discussed, as are ways to honor grief, find a therapist, provide self-care, rebuild a life, find joy, and parent while dealing with PTSD. Caregivers or anyone impacted by trauma will likely feel that Orange is on their side and respond well to her calls to seek "progress, not perfection."

In selecting these fifteen essential poems, Chilean poet Ra�l Zurita was guided by the question, "What poem, had it not been written, would have rendered the author another author and Latin American poetry something else?" This extraordinary gathering of talent&#x2014;from Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda to Ernesto Cardenal and C�sar Vallejo&#x2014;spans the twentieth century.</p><p>From "The Heights of Macchu Picchu":</p><p><i>How many times in the wintry streets of a city or ina bus or a boat at dusk, or in the deepest loneliness, a night of revelry beneath the soundof shadows and bells, in the very grotto of human pleasureI've tried to stop and seek the eternal unfathomable lodethat I touched before on stone or in the lightning unleashed by a kiss . . . </i></p><p><b>Ra�l Zurita</b>, winner of the Chilean National Prize for Literature, survived arrest and torture during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship.

His many honors include the Gertrude Stein Award for Innovative North American Poetry and a Guggenheim Fellowship; his books have been named finalists for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award.<br><br>Curated by award-winning Chilean poet Zurita, this bilingual anthology features one poem apiece from 15 Latin American poets. The selections, many of them quite lengthy, are intended to strike readers like the vastness of the Pacific or the peaks of the Andes. Zurita has chosen poets close to home, with six compatriot Chileans, and a preponderance of male poets. In an articulate and generous introduction, Zurita evaluates the authors against that pinnacle of Chilean male poets, Pablo Neruda. Each featured poet engages Neruda&#x2019;s legacy with varying measures of reverence, malice, imitation, and satire. Gabriela Mistral&#x2019;s role is as a foreshadowing figure; Nicanor Parra writes of the everyday; and Pablo de Rokha&#x2019;s fixation is with the ruins, not the heights, of Machu Picchu. While Zurita favors long lines and mythopoeic subject matter, the anthology benefits from Mexican poet Jaime Sabines&#x2019; disinterest in apocalyptic heroics, as well as Nicaraguan poet Ernesto Cardenal&#x2019;s relatively brief, tragicomic Prayer for Marilyn Monroe. Likewise, Zurita&#x2019;s inclusion of first-generation Argentines Alejandra Pizarnik and Juan Gelman adds to this well-defined, important primer on Latin American poetics. --Diego B�ez</p><h2>Ship of the Dead (An Omega Days Novel)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Readers who enjoyed The Strain Trilogy, by Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan, will find plenty to satisfy them here.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Book Review </i>on <i>Omega Days</i></b><br><b>In the weeks following the Omega Virus outbreak, survivors form desperate clusters, uniting to defend against hordes of the walking dead.

She should have tried harder to report to her unit. She did none of that and instead ran to save her own life. It hung on her as heavy as a cross, one she had carried since that terrible day.</p><p>That was the night Jimmy Albright punched the siren, blasting a high-pitched <i>WHOOP-WAAH</i> as he hauled the ambulance left, then snapped it hard right again, neatly cutting around a BMW that hadn&#x2019;t bothered to pull over for the flashing lights. The rig sped after a pair of San Francisco Police Department Crown Vics, slashing through traffic on the Embarcadero.</p><p>&#x201c;All I&#x2019;m saying is something&#x2019;s gotta give, Rosie.&#x201d; He was smoking in the rig, a supreme violation for Emergency Medical Service crews, the butt clenched between his teeth as he maneuvered the heavy vehicle like a sports car. His red hair was closely trimmed, and he was tall and rangy, thin but with ropy, muscled arms. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna burn yourself out.&#x201d;</p><p>The two cruisers split right and left around an Alhambra water truck, and Jimmy came up on its flat back end with sirens blaring, puffing cigarette smoke out the corner of his mouth before he cut right. He cleared the truck&#x2019;s bumper by six inches at forty-five miles per hour. In the seat beside him, Jimmy&#x2019;s partner didn&#x2019;t flinch. After three years together, Rosa was immune to his driving.</p><p>&#x201c;I got it under control,&#x201d; Rosa said. She was twenty-five, dark-haired and attractive, something noticed by every cop, medic, and fireman she encountered. Most of them asked her out. &#x201c;If it gets to be too much, I&#x2019;ll quit something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, sure.&#x201d; He stomped the brakes and flung the ambulance down an exit ramp.</p><p>Even in mid-August the evening was pleasant enough to let the open windows cool the cab, and Rosa cocked her right arm outside and watched as the city flashed by. &#x201c;You just want me to quit dancing.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t look at him.</p><p>The rig&#x2019;s tires squealed as he yanked it left, passing under the highway and chasing the two cruisers through the twilight streets. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to have one of <i>those</i> conversations, are we?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s not where I was going.&#x201d;</p><p>She shot him a look. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly where this is going.&#x201d;</p><p>Jimmy flicked the butt out the window and made a disgusted noise, the kind people make when they are yet again starting down a much-traveled and worn-out path. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re asking me if I want you to stop stripping for strange men&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dancing!&#x201d; Beneath the pressed white uniform shirt and dark blue cargo pants was a dancer&#x2019;s body, firm and full-figured, without the silicone enhancements employed by most of the girls at her part-time job. Jimmy knew what was under that uniform, although that was over now, which made this topic even more difficult.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh, dancing around a pole and taking your clothes off. You want me to lie? No, I don&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See? I told you.&#x201d; She flashed a triumphant smile and shook a finger at him. &#x201c;I told you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He braked, slowing as he went through an intersection against the light. &#x201c;I know you won&#x2019;t quit because you make too much money at it, and med school is going to be expensive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right!&#x201d; Rosa&#x2019;s face was burning. She didn&#x2019;t like talking to Jimmy about that part of her life. He was too close, both on the job and given their brief but pleasant time together, a relationship they had mutually agreed to end because it was making them distracted at work. And yet he was the only one with whom she <i>could</i> talk. It would kill her mother to find out, and her sister out in Sacramento could barely focus on a conversation with five kids constantly howling for her attention. Rosa didn&#x2019;t have a boyfriend; she had no time for one. Secretly, she doubted that a decent guy&#x2014;other than Jimmy&#x2014;would have a stripper as a girlfriend. <i>Dancer</i>, she corrected herself.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right!&#x201d; Jimmy shouted back, grinning and punching her arm across the cab of the rig, nearly sideswiping a parked car.</p><p>Rosa laughed and punched him back. &#x201c;You can be so stupid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m dragging my white-trash ass around in this rig. You, however, are not stupid, and you don&#x2019;t need this job. <i>This</i> is what you should quit.&#x201d;</p><p>The cab fell silent as Rosa stared at him, and Jimmy followed the cruisers into a neighborhood of four- and five-story buildings with ground-floor shops and apartments above. In the distance, still blocks away, red lights of the San Francisco Fire Department were sparkling. It was a non-fire call with injuries, their dispatcher had told them.</p><p>&#x201c;Jimmy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice was softer.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. Look at yourself, Rosie. You cranked out a bachelor&#x2019;s degree with pre-med in record time, you&#x2019;re about to start med school, and you&#x2019;ve told me a hundred times what the workload will be like. On top of it you&#x2019;ve got a Navy Reserve commitment. And dancing to pay for it all? You don&#x2019;t have time to be out here with me.&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned. This certainly wasn&#x2019;t what she had been expecting. &#x201c;I get practical experience out here. It keeps me sharp.&#x201d;</p><p>Jimmy scowled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a bullshit answer. You should have your nose in a book, Doc. You shouldn&#x2019;t be out here scraping bodies off the street, dealing with gunshot wounds, ODs, and abused kids. Up to your ass in human filth,&#x201d; he finished in a mutter.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t remember hearing him like this, so passionate and bordering on anger. For a moment her heart acted like it might do a little flip, and then settled. &#x201c;I like being out here with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah? Maybe you are stupid after all.&#x201d;</p><p>They were in the Rincon Hill section, just off Folsom. The rig rolled to a stop behind a squad car just as the officers were sprinting toward a commotion at the front of a building. To the EMS attendants it looked like a crowd of firemen were fighting with a mob of civilians in the street, the white glare of a fire truck&#x2019;s spotlight making a confusion of shadows dance on a brick wall.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; Jimmy said, clamping his right hand on Rosa&#x2019;s leg just as she was about to jump out. They watched, stunned, as a civilian grabbed a fireman by the head and bit off one of his ears. Someone screamed, and another fireman hurled himself into the fight, swinging an axe. Cops drew their weapons and fired, making three red circles appear in the chest and belly of a fat man in a bloody wife-beater. He didn&#x2019;t flinch, lumbered right at them and tackled a cop, pinning him with his weight. He bit the cop&#x2019;s ear off before going for the face. The fireman with the axe split a man&#x2019;s head open down the middle. The downed cop&#x2019;s partner executed the fat man with a pistol to the ear, then rolled his bulk to the side, screaming &#x201c;Medic!&#x201d;</p><p>Rosa was out the right door and running to the back. Jimmy met her there and they opened the double doors together, grabbing their bright orange kits. Jimmy suddenly pinned her to one of the doors and moved close, startling her. &#x201c;You be careful.&#x201d;</p><p>She pulled away from him impatiently. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; and then she ran to where one cop was crouched over his fallen partner, holding the man&#x2019;s head and pressing a hand to where an ear had once been. He was cursing steadily, glancing between his groaning partner and over to where the fireman with the axe, screaming like a mad Viking, had just put down another civilian. Two more people, both Asian women, were clamped to the fireman&#x2019;s legs, chewing into his knees and thighs. No other cops were in sight, despite the second patrol car.</p><p>Rosa pulled on heavy purple latex gloves with a snapping noise and dropped beside the two cops, opening her kit. &#x201c;I got him,&#x201d; she said, pressing a thick gauze pad against the side of the man&#x2019;s head and shouldering his partner out of the way. That cop stared at her for a moment, blinked, and started walking toward the raging fireman, raising his service weapon.</p><p>Jimmy Albright saw the gun coming up and cut left away from it, running toward the stoop of an adjacent building, where another fireman was curled into a fetal position, blood soaking the concrete around him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming, buddy.&#x201d; He dropped his kit and knelt, pulling on his gloves.</p><p>Rosa&#x2019;s cop was struggling to sit up, gritting his teeth. &#x201c;Fucking guy bit my fucking ear off. Marco! Where the fuck did you go?&#x201d;</p><p>Marco continued to walk slowly toward the axe-wielding fireman and shot one of the Asian women on his leg through the head at point-blank range. The snarling body collapsed, but the bullet blasted through the skull and shattered the fireman&#x2019;s knee. With a scream the fireman spun and swung the axe, cutting halfway through the cop&#x2019;s neck, making the head flop to one side. As the cop sagged to his knees, the fireman took the head all the way off with a second blow, screaming something unintelligible. The ruined knee collapsed beneath him on the second swing, and the other woman clawed up his body until she was able to bite out his throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Marco!&#x201d; cried the downed cop, still trying to see as Rosa pushed him back to the pavement.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing his job,&#x201d; she said, hearing sirens and the beat of a helicopter in the distance. &#x201c;How we doing, Jimmy?&#x201d;</p><p>No reply.</p><p>She looked up and saw Jimmy on his back, eyes wide and sightless as a bloody fireman crouched over him, pulling red insides out of the medic&#x2019;s body and cramming them into his mouth.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Jimmy!&#x201d;</i> She bolted to her feet and ran toward them. The fireman looked up from feeding with glassy yellow eyes and growled. Jimmy&#x2019;s body twitched. Rosa screamed his name again and ran back to the cop, ripping the nine-millimeter from his holster as he shouted a protest. She quickly checked the chamber and flicked off the safety, more than familiar with the weapon after a full tour in Iraq as a Navy corpsman assigned to combat Marines. Rosa walked to the thing eating her friend. &#x201c;Fucker,&#x201d; she whispered, and shot it in the forehead.</p><p>Her partner twitched again, and she let out a cry of relief, dropping to her knees beside him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here, Jimmy.&#x201d; She started to cry. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right here, baby.&#x201d;</p><p>An off-key chorus of moans came from her right, and Rosa turned to see the axe-wielding fireman hobbling toward her on a shattered knee, his throat a raw, red void with flaps of esophagus hanging out of it. The Asian woman who had killed him lurched a step behind, and then more shapes, firemen and civilians and one of the cops from the empty cruiser they had seen when they arrived&#x2014;all of them torn apart&#x2014;shuffled out from behind a nearby Dumpster and one of the big red-and-chrome trucks. Her attention, however, was drawn to the decapitated cop&#x2019;s head, lying on one ear and looking at her with filmy eyes. Its jaw worked silently, snapping at nothing.</p><p>Rosa turned and ran.</p><p>The cop Rosa had treated propped himself up on his elbows and saw what was coming. &#x201c;Holy Christ!&#x201d; He clawed for the hideout pistol strapped to his ankle and fired four times, hitting and missing, but stopping nothing, and then scrambled to his feet and ran into the deepening gloom.</p><p>Rosa jumped into the ambulance without bothering to shut any of the doors, watching the cop run away. She thought of how the Marines she had served with never left anyone behind, how they had ingrained that philosophy into their corpsmen, the Navy medics they all called &#x201c;Doc.&#x201d; But that was war, and this was some hellish nightmare, a drug addict&#x2019;s dark fantasy.</p><p>And yet Jimmy had moved.</p><p>No, he couldn&#x2019;t be alive after what she had seen. None of them could.</p><p>A moment later a bloody palm slapped against the windshield and she screamed. Rosa wedged the cop&#x2019;s pistol between her thigh and the seat, threw the ambulance into a rocking, three-point turn, and seconds later was roaring away from the scene. She began whispering a Hail Mary as tears ran down her face.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>A police helicopter&#x2014;one of the few remaining since San Francisco decommissioned all but a few of its fleet years earlier&#x2014;hovered slowly up Main Street. It paused to put a spotlight on the ambulance parked at a curb with its emergency lights flashing and rear doors hanging open. The beat of the downdraft whipped the trees along the nearby sidewalk, blowing leaves off limbs, and then the chopper moved on.</p><p>Rosa was in the driver&#x2019;s seat, knees pulled up to her chest and arms wrapped tightly about them, rocking and crying. Jimmy was dead. She had left him there, and he was dead. She had run away. Her sobs filled the cab where there had once been two voices as she pressed her face against her knees, body shaking. Headlights slid by, but no one stopped.</p><p>Only a few blocks away from the slaughter, she stayed there for fifteen minutes, until her tears stopped and her hands quit shaking. She called her mother&#x2019;s house, but there was no answer. She got out, closed the rear doors, and returned to the driver&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>The radio was going mad. Calls to 911 and chattering code filled the airwaves, excited voices calling for more units, for Life Flight, for police and fire. Gunfire sounded in the background of some of the calls. And screams. The dispatcher called for Jimmy and Rosa&#x2019;s unit, eager to send them on another call. Rosa ignored the radio.</p><p>Main was a one-way street, and she took it up across Mission, leaving the emergency lights on and banging the siren built into the rig&#x2019;s horn to clear traffic. Around her, all appeared normal, people out at night unaware of the madness she had left behind. At the intersection of Market, however, she came to a full stop. SFPD was setting up yellow sawhorses, their cars crowding the street, all of their attention focused on the wide, brightly lit entrance to the Embarcadero BART station. Every officer seemed to be carrying a shotgun. One of them saw her at the corner and waved her in.</p><p>Rosa had no intention of getting involved in whatever this was, so she eased forward slowly, maneuvering around a sawhorse, aiming for the street on the far side of the intersection. She was a third of the way across when bodies spilled out of the BART station entrance, hundreds of them, mostly dressed in business attire that had once been pressed and sharp but was now bloody and torn. They staggered and lurched, pressing forward even though most had great chunks of flesh torn from their bodies, others with limbs twisted at painful angles or missing altogether.</p><p>A pair of tear gas canisters was fired into their midst. The crowd pushed through, more flowing out of the station behind them. A bullhorn command was given, and Rosa jumped as a volley of shotgun and pistol fire exploded into the crowd.</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t slow.</p><p>More firing, and then the crowd was spreading out, tipping over barricades and pawing their way down the sides of police cars, cops falling back as the torn and bloodied commuters slammed into them like a wall, moaning and clutching and biting. Rosa stomped the accelerator and shot across the intersection. A young woman in what had once been a smart gray business suit&#x2014;now with half her face torn away and her lower jaw missing&#x2014;stumbled in front of the rig as Rosa hit the gas. She bounced off the grille with a thump and went fly...</p></p><h2>Skinhead Confessions: From Hate To Hope</h2><p>A background in hate. A life of violence. A love for power. But all he needed was a moment of truth. I heard the gasp of horror and knew I&#39;d been caught. &#34;What are those?&#34; she cried, pointing at my body, which was covered from neck to waist in graphic, sinister tattoos. No way was I going to tell her what they meant - the hate crimes I&#39;d committed, the people I&#39;d stabbed and maimed to earn those tattoos. No way was I going to tell her about the hundreds of kids I&#39;d initiated to follow me into the White Power movement and the things they did for me every day. From his youth, TJ Leyden was taught to fight, to hurt, and to hate. Cunningly brilliant and deceptively clean-cut, TJ found that life with the Skinheads was exactly what he - and they - needed. Quickly rising to the top, TJ recruited members for the Skins, and in return he earned a name and a reputation as one of the most powerful men in the White Power movement. With a skill for fanning the fires of hatred and an ability to elude the law, it seemed that nothing would stop TJ - that is, until he became a father. As his own children grew, so did TJ&#39;s uncertainty about the cause he&#39;d endorsed for so long. One fact finally emerged from all the racist propaganda: white power wasn&#39;t about being white; it was simply about having someone to hate. And once he realized this truth, TJ knew his life could never been the same. Skinhead Confessions takes you on an unbelievable ride through a dark world of violence to one of openness and faith in the future. TJ&#39;s honesty and courage - even in the face of death - have inspired people across America to take action against gang violence and hate crimes. A book unlike any other, this is the amazing true story of one person&#39;s journey from hatred to hope.</p><p>From his youth, TJ Leyden was taught to fight, to hurt, and to hate.

Seriously, if we could have found a way to put TJ in jail, we would have because of his political views. We were much more interested in him than any of his underlings, and we were gathering as much intelligence on him as we could to build a case that would put him away for a long, long time. The problem was TJ's influence over the youngsters. He helped make the problem in the community much bigger than we wanted it to be. His influence was too widespread. --Del Jensen, a detective from the San Bernardino sheriff's department<br><br>The thing I like about TJ is that he is REAL.

The Church is now debating the validity of Genesis as actual history, the reality of hell itself, and even if Adam was a real person.

In this collection of interviews and public talks, he reflects on the sit-ins, boycotts, strikes, urban rebellions, and anticolonial movements that have animated the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries. Kadalie demonstrates how the forms of direct democracy that have evolved through these freedom struggles present the promise of a future defined by social liberation as well as ecological healing.<br>This concise, radical, and iconoclastic book connects Black liberation struggles to ecological activism in the era of climate change, calling on present and future generations of activists to reconnect with the spirit of past movements without lionizing individual leaders or lending legitimacy to any governments or politicians.</p><p>Modibo Kadalie is a social ecologist and lifelong revolutionary organizer. In the 1970s, he was a member of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers and the African Liberation Support Committee and a delegate to the Sixth Pan-African Congress. He is the founding convener of the Autonomous Research Institute for Direct Democracy and Social Ecology and the author of <em>Internationalism, Pan-Africanism, and the Struggle of Social Classes</em>."Modibo Kadalie is a storyteller--in the most honorable and powerful sense of the word--who opens up the possibilities of fundamental social transformation. In these short, accessible talks, his own experiences in Pan-African resistance movements become gateways to our rich, collective history of liberation struggles. Lessons about the centrality of human relationships to nature as well as the dangers inherent to all state formations emerge organically, reminding us that power and truth always reside in the people, not their 'leaders.'"<br><br>--Natsu Saito, author of <em>Settler Colonialism, Race, and the Law: Why Structural Racism Persists</em><br>"In this rousing collection of recent speeches, essays, and conversations, Modibo Kadalie elaborates a vision of Pan-African social ecology rooted in the Black anarchist tradition, people's power, ecofeminism, and lessons from global struggles as wide-ranging as Rojava, Cheran, and Vieques. [. . .] Following C.L.R. James's dictum that 'any cook can govern,' Kadalie lifts up--and acts in concert with--ordinary people who have fought to preserve their autonomy and re-make the world. I am grateful that he has shared his immense wisdom with us in this collection."<br><br>--Jackie Wang, author of <em>Carceral Capitalism</em><br><br>"This updated exposition of direct democracy--a political process that has long engaged Modibo Kadalie's intellectual energies--is empowering and helpful to scholars and activists alike. Kadalie reviews past and present human efforts to repair and improve their societies in the wake of wars, revolutions, and natural disasters. In producing this latest work, the author has inserted into the complex current of debate, reflection, and action the necessary intellectual equipment for coping with a manifest social and ecological crisis in the age of climate change."<br><br>--Eusi Kwayana, author of <em>The Bauxite Strike and the Old Politics</em><br><br>"<em>Pan-African Social Ecology</em> comes to us as a guide stamped by time and rooted in praxis. Modibo Kadalie's lengthy experience and blunt expression are a refreshing reminder that liberation is a long road that will take our consistent work. This collection offers a gift of understanding and clarity in a way we shouldn't take for granted and at a time when almost nothing feels certain."<br><br>--William C. Anderson, co-author of <em>As Black As Resistance</em><br>"Modibo's work emerges at a moment in history when industrial production has resulted in an imbalance wherein people of color around the world are the first to feel the effects of environmental catastrophe. There is growing recognition, however, that unchecked growth based on excessive resource consumption and the use of non-renewable resources can no longer be sustained. Indeed, capitalist growth reproduces inequality. Modibo examines the grassroots response to these social and ecological crises and the revolutionary ecological potential demonstrated by the 'mutual aid' among everyday people."<br><br>--Cynthia Hamilton, Professor Emeritus and former Chair of African-American Studies, University of Rhode Island</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter Slipcase Edition)</h2><p><p><i>'There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways . their magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.'</i></p><p>The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it through - alive! </p><p>This gift edition hardback, presented in a beautiful foiled slipcase decorated with brand new line art by Jonny Duddle, will delight readers as they cheer Harry on through his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p></p><p>In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

If there was any doubt in Archie Clarke&#x2019;s mind what the illustration was intended to depict, the book&#x2019;s title, The Conquest of Space, made it obvious. It was a spaceship. The captivating image reminded him of the colorful covers of the American science-�fiction magazines that he had seen in the back room of Woolworth&#x2019;s.<br><br>Spectacled fourteen-�year-�old Archie peered into the small W. H. Smith bookshop located a short distance from his grandmother&#x2019;s house on England&#x2019;s Bristol Channel. Dressed in short pants and an Oxford shirt, Archie was walking with his aunt Nellie toward Minehead&#x2019;s main shopping arcade. It was 1932, and Archie had recently lost his father, after a long illness exacerbated by injuries sustained during a German poison-�gas attack in World War I. He routinely visited his grandmother and aunt in the small but active southwest England beach resort during the weekends and holidays, leaving his mother freer to attend to his younger siblings on the remote family farm a few miles away.<br><br>Nellie Willis, a tall young woman with an intelligent face framed by a brown bob, doted on her clever nephew. She could see that the book displayed in the shop window fascinated him. Despite the family&#x2019;s struggling finances, she gave Archie the &#x201c;six and seven&#x201d;&#x2014;�six shillings and seven pence&#x2014;�to purchase it and bring it home.<br><br>But when Archie opened the book, he discovered it wasn&#x2019;t the adventure story that he had expected. Instead, he was looking at a book detailing the fundamentals of rocket science&#x2014;�astronautics&#x2014;�supplemented with an imagined account of the first journey to the Moon. Until this moment Archie had assumed space travel was a fantasy. Now he learned that it was actually possible for humans to leave their planet and explore space and that it could happen in the not-�too-�distant future.<br><br>Decades later, as one of the world&#x2019;s leading masters of science fiction and the co-�author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke would point to that day in 1932 as the moment his life changed. His imagination had been energized by a book, prompting him to wonder about what it might be like when humans began to explore space. In the early 1930s, few in government, media, or business regarded human space travel as a serious possibility. But in Archie Clarke&#x2019;s mind it held transformative and liberating options. If the human species could escape the confines of gravity, was it conceivable that other fantastic possibilities might come to pass in the near future as well?<br><br>Archie&#x2019;s fascination with the promise of space travel would motivate and determine the direction of his life following that chance encounter with The Conquest of Space. He joined a small cadre of visionaries, theorists, and space-�travel advocates whose youthful dreams, curiosity, and determination led directly to humanity&#x2019;s first steps on an alien world only three decades later.<br><br>The theoretical mathematics upon which all rocket science was based had begun to circulate in prominent scientific journals only a decade before the publication of The Conquest of Space. In the early twentieth century, three independent-�minded theorists, intrigued by the idea of space travel after reading works of science fiction as adolescents, attempted to solve the theoretical physics necessary to carry out an actual escape from Earth&#x2019;s gravity. Working autonomously, Russia&#x2019;s Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, American professor Robert Goddard, and physicist Hermann Oberth in Germany conducted their research and study in each of the three countries that would later witness the most decisive events of the early space age. All three theorists were social outsiders intrigued by utopian ideals, and each harbored a personal belief that space travel would inevitably transform human destiny.<br><br>The first stirrings of the modern space age arose not in a wealthy industrial nation but in agrarian czarist Russia. At the turn of the century, a popular spiritual philosophy called cosmism&#x2014;�a mixture of elements from Eastern and Western thought, animism, theosophy, and mystical aspects of the Russian Orthodox Church&#x2014;�had influenced a new generation of writers, scientists, and intellectuals. For Russian cosmists, space travel would be the ultimate liberation; once the shackles of the Earth&#x2019;s gravity had been removed and humans inhabited space, the souls of the dead would be resurrected and all humanity would partake in cosmic immortality.<br><br>The founding philosopher of Russian cosmism, Nikolai Fedorov, a noted librarian and scholar, chose to personally tutor a bright but impoverished teenager who had been prohibited from attending school due to severe deafness. The student, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, had an eccentric and strikingly independent intellect and within a few years was hired as a small-�town schoolmaster, despite his disability. In his spare time, Tsiolkovsky conducted independent research on many scientific subjects, including space travel. He had read Jules Verne&#x2019;s From the Earth to the Moon during his adolescence, and later he even tried his hand at writing his own fictional scientific romances.<br><br>In 1903 Tsiolkovsky published a scientific paper that contained the first appearance of what came to be known as the &#x201c;rocket equation,&#x201d; a mathematical formula comparing a rocket&#x2019;s mass ratio to its velocity, the essential calculation necessary to determine how to escape a planet&#x2019;s gravity. Unfortunately, the importance of his publication went unnoticed; the Russian scientific community ignored his work, dismissing it as the musings of an amateur. His paper would remain unread for another twenty years. Undaunted, Tsiolkovsky continued his studies, going on to publish nearly four hundred scientific papers on such matters as space-�vehicle weightlessness, the operation of multi-�staged launch vehicles, the orbital dynamics of differing rocket burns, and the scientific advantages of polar orbits.<br><br>A full decade after Tsiolkovsky&#x2019;s groundbreaking paper, in 1913, a French aircraft designer named Robert Esnault-�Pelterie independently published his own version of the rocket equation. But once again few took notice. In the United States, Robert Goddard, the second of the three pioneers of rocketry and a part-�time instructor and research fellow at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, was quietly conducting his own rocket research. Entirely unaware of Tsiolkovsky or Esnault-�Pelterie, he submitted patent applications for both a liquid-�fueled rocket and a multi-�stage vehicle.<br><br>Like Tsiolkovsky, Goddard had also experienced social isolation during his formative years. A frail only child, he was kept out of school for extended periods due to ill health. As a result, he didn&#x2019;t graduate from high school until age twenty-�one. During his solitary time at home he read stacks of books from the local library, particularly volumes from the science and technology shelves. He also read H. G. Wells&#x2019;s science-�fiction classic The War of the Worlds, which made a lasting impression. At age seventeen in 1899, while aloft in the branches of a cherry tree on his family&#x2019;s New England farm, Goddard experienced an epiphany that moved him so deeply that he noted the date on which it occurred. &#x201c;As I looked towards the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars. I was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended for existence at last seemed very purposive.&#x201d;<br><br>During World War I, while teaching at Clark University, Goddard obtained research funding from the War Department for an experimental tube-�launched solid-�fuel rocket rifle, an early version of what would become the bazooka. He also proposed a rocket that could ascend seventy miles into the atmosphere and carry high explosives or poison gas at least two hundred miles. But after the Armistice, no American military officials thought long-�range missiles a subject worthy of further research, so Goddard sought to find support elsewhere.<br><br>It was a technical paper funded and published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1920 that suddenly placed Goddard&#x2019;s name on newspaper front pages around the world. &#x201c;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&#x201d; proposed that a rocket could be used for the scientific exploration of the atmosphere, placing artificial satellites into orbit, aiding weather forecasting, and physically hitting the Moon. His paper made no mention of human space travel to the Moon; however, many newspaper reports heralded his study with dramatic headlines implying Goddard was working on a moon rocket that would transport human passengers.</p><h2>The Odds of Getting Even (Mo &amp; Dale Mysteries)</h2><p><b>Humor and action abound in this second follow-up to the Newbery honor winner and New York Times bestseller, Three Times Lucky</b><br><br>The trial of the century has come to Tupelo Landing, NC.

It gave my best friend Dale Earnhardt Johnson III a triple shot of worry before the courthouse even opened its doors.</p><p>In the first place, Mr. Macon Johnson is Dale&#x2019;s daddy.</p><p>In the second place, Dale and me&#x2014;cofounders of Desperado Detective Agency&#x2014;helped put Mr. Macon behind bars last summer, making us top witnesses against him.</p><p>And in the third place, Dale&#x2019;s the first in his family ever to testify on the side of the law.</p><p>The idea of his daddy&#x2019;s trial twisted Dale so hard, he forgot how to sleep.</p><p>As for me&#x2014;Miss Moses LoBeau, a sixth grader in her prime&#x2014;I looked forward to sending Mr. Macon to the slammer where he belongs. Nobody hurts Dale without hearing from me. Nobody kidnaps the Colonel and Miss Lana without answering to me, either. The Colonel and Miss Lana are my family-of-choice, and I am theirs. As best friend, Dale is family too.</p><p>Besides, a conviction would look good for Desperado Detective Agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This case is a slam dunk,&#x201d; I reminded the Colonel the day before the trial. &#x201c;Dale and me<i> heard</i> Mr. Macon confess.&#x201d; He closed the trunk of our vintage Underbird (which used to be a Thunderbird until the <i>T </i>and <i>H</i> fell off) and sent the Piggly Wiggly grocery cart careening across the parking lot.</p><p>&#x201c;A slam dunk?&#x201d; The Colonel snorted. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing, Mo. An infinite number of things can always go wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>The Colonel&#x2019;s handsome in a rugged, don&#x2019;t-mess-with-me way. He wears his hair short and bristly and his muscles strong and lean. &#x201c;Fasten your seat belt, Soldier. And don&#x2019;t get your hopes up over this trial.&#x201d;</p><p>We zipped through Tupelo Landing, NC&#x2014;population 148&#x2014;and headed for the caf� we run with Miss Lana, at the edge of town.</p><p>&#x201c;Cat,&#x201d; I said, reaching across the Colonel&#x2019;s arm and hitting the horn. An orange cat shot to the sidewalk. The Colonel likes to pretend he wouldn&#x2019;t have swerved.</p><p>I know better.</p><p>I waved at Dale&#x2019;s brother, Lavender, the dashing racecar driver I will go out with in just seven more years, as he tooled by in his blue 1955 GMC pickup truck. Miss Lana says nobody&#x2019;s perfect. I say Lavender proves her wrong.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think will happen tomorrow?&#x201d; I asked the Colonel.</p><p>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ll be good friends to Dale,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be easy to send your father to jail, even if he&#x2019;s Macon Johnson. And I think we&#x2019;ll tell the truth. Beyond that, it&#x2019;s a crap shoot. But <i>if</i> everything goes as expected, we all testify, the judge rules, and Macon goes to prison for a very long time.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course, nothing went as expected.</p><p>By sundown the next day, Dale and his mama needed a bodyguard, Lavender&#x2019;s life hung in the balance, and the Desperado Detective Agency had a case we&#x2019;d never want in a million years.</p><p>It&#x2019;s hard to say when things started going sideways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life still felt on track as the Colonel and me lugged our groceries around the side of the caf� and into our home in the back half of our building. We seemed on track an hour later when Miss Lana peeked in the door to my flat&#x2014;which my enemies say is nothing but a closed-in side porch opening off our living room.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have your courtroom outfit ready, sugar?&#x201d; Miss Lana asked, smoothing her Marilyn Monroe wig. Costuming counts with Miss Lana, a former child star of the Charleston community theater. So do staging and dramatic pauses.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I said, nodding to my rocking chair. I&#x2019;d laid out my new blue jeans and my clean-enough red sweater. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going as a normal sixth grader,&#x201d; I added as my phone jangled.</p><p>She sashayed off as I scooped up the receiver. &#x201c;Desperado Detective Agency. Felonies are our delight, lost pets our duty. How may we assist you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mo, it&#x2019;s me. Dale.&#x201d; Like I wouldn&#x2019;t recognize my best friend&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Meet me outside. Daddy&#x2019;s invited us over, but we ain&#x2019;t got much time.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Over</i> would be to the county jail.</p><p>&#x201c;Harm&#x2019;s going too,&#x201d; he said. Harm, who&#x2019;s new in town, is my best friend next to Dale.</p><p>I hesitated. Miss Lana says be sensitive and the Colonel says tell the truth. It can be a mind-pretzeling combination. &#x201c;No thank you to visiting your mean-as-a-snake daddy, but I appreciate the invitation. And I can&#x2019;t believe Miss Rose is taking you to county lockup,&#x201d; I added.</p><p>&#x201c;Mama&#x2019;s not taking me,&#x201d; Dale said. &#x201c;Lavender is.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Lavender?</i></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get my jacket,&#x201d; I replied, and hung up the phone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Five minutes later Lavender wheeled his graceful old pickup truck into our parking lot. Lanky Harm Crenshaw, who has manners, hopped out and held the door for me. &#x201c;Afternoon, LoBeau,&#x201d; he said, swinging his tattered gray scarf over his shoulder.</p><p>Harm&#x2019;s tall for a sixth grader. Lately he&#x2019;s been too fashionable to wear a coat, preferring to go scarf-and-sweater for a manly look. If Harm was old enough to shave, he wouldn&#x2019;t. Ever since him and Dale formed a singing group, he&#x2019;s trying to be popular with girls older than him.</p><p>He&#x2019;s already popular with me. &#x201c;Hey yourself, Harm Crenshaw.&#x201d;</p><p>I peered inside the cab. &#x201c;Excuse me, Dale. You&#x2019;re in my seat.&#x201d; Dale rolled his eyes, which are as blue as Lavender&#x2019;s, and slid out. Even his freckles looked peeved.</p><p>I slipped in next to Lavender, who smelled like motor oil. Lavender will one day be NASCAR famous. Until then, he fixes things. Dale and Harm crowded in and slammed the door. If we fit any tighter, we&#x2019;d have to alternate breathing.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Mr. Macon want?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing good,&#x201d; Lavender said, heading through town. &#x201c;I wish you&#x2019;d change your mind about visiting him, little brother.&#x201d;</p><p>Dale shook his head. &#x201c;I got things to ask. Some I can ask you and the Colonel, but some just Daddy knows. This is my last chance.&#x201d; He peeked at Lavender. &#x201c;I wish you&#x2019;d come. It&#x2019;s mostly you he wants to see. He says it&#x2019;s important.&#x201d;</p><p>Lavender took the truck through her gears smooth as water. &#x201c;Sorry, Dale. Whatever Macon wants, I don&#x2019;t have it anymore.&#x201d; He poked at a newspaper on the dash. &#x201c;You Desperados made the paper again.&#x201d;</p><p>Harm read the story out loud:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>MACON JOHNSON TRIAL OPENS TOMORROW<br></b>Small-time crook Macon Johnson goes to trial tomorrow. He&#x2019;s accused of helping Robert Slate and Deputy Marla Everette kidnap two of Tupelo Landing&#x2019;s citizens&#x2014;Miss Lana and the Colonel, of caf� fame.<br>Eleven-year-olds Mo LoBeau and Dale Earnhardt Johnson III of Desperado Detective Agency helped capture Macon Johnson, and are top witnesses against him.<br>&#x201c;Daddy&#x2019;s mean to me and Mama, and people say we&#x2019;re better off with him in jail. But don&#x2019;t write that down,&#x201d; Dale told reporters at the time of the arrest. &#x201c;I only turned Daddy in because he confessed to the kidnapping.&#x201d;<br>Mo had a different take: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to testify. I&#x2019;ll get even with Mr. Macon if it&#x2019;s the last thing I do.&#x201d;<br>The Desperados also captured Deputy Marla Everette and Robert Slate, who will stand trial next year. Their list of alleged crimes includes breaking and entering, bank robbery, kidnapping, and murder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dale slumped. &#x201c;It sounds bad when you read it in that newspaper voice.&#x201d;</p><p>We wheeled into the jail&#x2019;s parking lot.</p><p>&#x201c;Dale, if you&#x2019;re determined to do this, I&#x2019;ll wait right here for you,&#x201d; Lavender said, cutting the ignition. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve said it before, but I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t go in there. Not this time, little brother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got to,&#x201d; Dale said. Dale can be stubborn. He looked at Harm and me. &#x201c;Daddy got this set up special for us. Visiting hours are almost over. Let&#x2019;s roll.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Macon sat in the cafeteria-style visiting room, tense as a snarl of wire. Dale took a seat across from him. Harm and me sat, flanking Dale like bodyguards.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for calling,&#x201d; Dale said. &#x201c;I been wanting to talk. I guess my messages didn&#x2019;t get through.&#x201d; He slipped a paper from his pocket.</p><p>I peeked over. At the top it said,&nbsp;<i>Things to Ask</i>. Underneath lay a haphazard spatter of words and squiggles.</p><p>Dale ain&#x2019;t a linear thinker.</p><p>Mr. Macon shot a look at the door. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Lavender? It&#x2019;s Lavender I need to talk to, not you.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Lana says never plunge into business without exchanging pleasantries.</p><p>I smiled at Mr. Macon, who pretty much hates me. &#x201c;I love what you&#x2019;ve done with the place,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Is that new paint? Because the gray tones really make your orange jumpsuit pop. As for Lavender, he can&#x2019;t make it due to the fact that he&#x2019;s not coming. Dale showed up for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell Lavender to get in here. It&#x2019;s important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I said so.&#x201d;</p><p>We didn&#x2019;t move. I watched Mr. Macon&#x2019;s face&#x2014;all angles and planes, like clay cut with a knife.</p><p>His eyes glittered. &#x201c;Dale, how&#x2019;s your mama?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Dale said, studying his note. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just me and her now. I&#x2019;m man of the house, and I got questions.&#x201d;</p><p>Dale? The second-smallest kid in sixth grade? The man of the house?</p><p>Dale looked into his father&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;If you go away, Mama and me won&#x2019;t have your get-even reputation to keep us safe anymore. I thought about getting a security system, but they cost, so I traded for guinea fowl instead. Guineas shriek every time anything moves. <i>You</i> know birds: We got coyotes running at night, do I need to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stupid plan,&#x201d; Mr. Macon said, his voice razor-quick. He leaned forward. &#x201c;I hear Lavender has a new racecar. Tell him to come talk to me about it.&#x201d;</p><p><i>He&#x2019;s going away for fifteen years and he wants to talk racecars?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Time&#x2019;s running out, Dale,&#x201d; Harm whispered, glancing at the clock.</p><p>Dale sighed and skipped to the last item on his list. &#x201c;Good luck in court tomorrow, Daddy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I hope they don&#x2019;t call my name to testify, but if they do, I came here to ask you to pre-forgive me. It would mean a lot.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Macon took a cigarette from behind his ear and tapped the filter on the table. &#x201c;Life&#x2019;s about getting, and then about keeping. I take care of what&#x2019;s mine. I hoped you&#x2019;d be man enough to do the same by the time you got on that witness stand, but you always have been a mama&#x2019;s boy.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;Do what you got to tomorrow, <i>boy</i>. But remember this: I won&#x2019;t be in here forever.&#x201d;</p><p>Harm stood up. &#x201c;That sounds like a threat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does it?&#x201d; Mr. Macon asked, rising. Harm pushed in front of Dale and me, his hands balled into fists, and the guard bustled over.</p><p>&#x201c;Time to go, folks,&#x201d; the guard said. &#x201c;Sorry, Macon.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Macon glared at Dale. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Earl. I&#x2019;m done with him.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Macon knows how to make words into knives and he knows where to slice. My hate for him blossomed all over again. &#x201c;Is that why you called Dale over here?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;To bully him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t call for him,&#x201d; he said, walking to the door. &#x201c;I want Lavender. Tell him to see me. If he won&#x2019;t come, tell him he&#x2019;d better watch his back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does <i>that</i> mean?&#x201d; I demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Shut your motor mouth and do what I say.&#x201d;</p><p>My temper went off like the Fourth of July. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get yours tomorrow!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;Me and my motor mouth will make sure of it.&#x201d;</p><p>His steps echoed down the hall.</p><p>My temper&#x2019;s a work-in-progress. So far it&#x2019;s all work and no progress.</p><p>Dale slipped his list in his pocket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Dale,&#x201d; I said, my anger cooling like a kettle taken off a stove. &#x201c;He just makes me so mad, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Dale said. &#x201c;Daddy brings out the worst in people. Also in dogs. It&#x2019;s a reverse talent he&#x2019;s got.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Forget about him,&#x201d; Harm said, but of course Dale couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Back in the truck, Dale sat silent as sawdust while Harm and me filled Lavender in.</p><p>&#x201c;Mo&#x2019;s right. He&#x2019;s a bully,&#x201d; Lavender told Dale. &#x201c;We Johnson men aren&#x2019;t afraid of bullies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; Dale said. &#x201c;A little bit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there tomorrow. So will the Colonel.&#x201d; Lavender studied Dale&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;And as for being a mama&#x2019;s boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Lavender gave him a gentle shove. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re nothing like Macon. I&#x2019;d rather be Rose&#x2019;s son than Macon&#x2019;s boy any day of the week.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That night I plucked the <i>Piggly Wiggly Chronicles</i> Volume 7 from my bookshelf, hopped into bed, and picked up my pen. The <i>Chronicles</i> go back to my kindergarten days, when I first started writing to the Upstream Mother who lost me in a hurricane flood on the day I was born. I used to think I&#x2019;d find her. Now I mostly write to keep track of my life, but you never know&#x2014;she could show up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear Upstream Mother,</p><p>Dale and me testify against Mr. Macon tomorrow, and I&#x2019;ll be glad to see him go. Mr. Macon&#x2019;s the kind of mean you can taste in the back of your mouth.</p><p>Why Miss Rose ever married him remains a mystery.

This is the position of religious naturalists, who deny the existence of a deity and a supernatural realm. In this book, Loyal Rue answers critics by describing how religious naturalism can provide a satisfying vision of the meaning of human existence. <br><br> The work begins with a discussion of how to evaluate the meaning of life itself, referencing a range of thought from ancient Greek philosophy to the Abrahamic traditions to the Enlightenment to contemporary process and postmodern philosophies. Ultimately proposing meaning as an emergent property of living organisms, Rue writes that a meaningful life comes through happiness and virtue. Spiritual qualities that combine evolutionary cosmology and biocentric morality are described: reverence, gratitude, awe, humility, relatedness, compassion, and hope. Rue looks at why religious naturalism is not currently more of a movement, but nevertheless predicts that it will become the prevailing religious sensibility.<p>Loyal Rue is Professor of Religion and Philosophy at Luther College.

Want to get into the Zone but don't have the time? Now, in this all&#x2013;new collection of easy and delicious recipes, Dr. Barry Sears, the bestselling author of The Zone and Mastering the Zone shows you how to prepare more than 150 Zone&#x2013;Perfect recipes in minutes.</p><p> If you want to think better, perform better, look better, and live better, <em>Zone&#x2013;Perfect Meals in Minutes</em> will get you there and keep you there.</p></p><p>Barry Sears got a lot of attention--and royalties--with his diet books <i>The Zone</i> and <i>Mastering the Zone</i>. Sears believes that the food you eat is one of the most powerful drugs you will ever encounter, and a lot of people get fat and sick using food in misguided ways. Sears believes that using it the <i>right</i> way can lead to increased physical stamina, sharpened mental focus, and a reduced likelihood of developing chronic diseases--and you'll probably shed unwanted pounds along the way. Sears calls for a diet based on "hormonal thinking," not the usual calorie counting and fat measuring. Some of the rules of the diet are eating small meals throughout the day, having some protein at every meal, always eating the necessary amount of fruits and vegetables, and taking cod-liver oil. To make all of this as painless as possible, Sears has created 150 "Zone"-perfect meals that are easy to prepare and require little planning.<p>Dr. Barry Sears is recognized as one of the world's leading medical researchers on the hormonal effects of food.

Originally, the German 16. Armee occupied Demyansk in the fall of 1941 because it was key terrain - a crossroads located on high ground amidst a sea of swampy terrain - that would be used as a springboard for an eventual offensive into the Valdai Hills. Instead, the Soviet winter counteroffensive in February 1942 encircled the German II Armeekorps and other units, totalling about 100,000 troops, inside the Demyansk Pocket. Another pocket was also created around Kholm, with another 5,000 Germans inside. Yet despite severe pounding from five Soviet armies, the embattled German troops held the pocket and the Luftwaffe organized a major aerial resupply effort to sustain the defenders. For the first time in military history, an army was supplied entirely by air.</p><p>After stopping the Soviet winter counteroffensive, the German 16. Armee mounted two major relief efforts to rescue their trapped forces in the Demyansk and Kholm pockets, which were finally relieved in April-May 1942. During the siege, the crack 3. SS-Division 'Totenkopf' was virtually destroyed, suffering 80 per cent casualties. However, Hitler demanded that the 12 divisions of II Armeekorps remain in the narrow Demyansk salient, whose base was only 6km wide. Throughout the summer and autumn of 1942, the Soviets pounded the salient from all sides, inflicting heavy casualties on the defenders. In February 1943, Marshal Timoshenko was ordered to launch an offensive to cut off the base of the salient and annihilate the 12 divisions. At the same time, Hitler finally came to his senses after the Stalingrad debacle and authorized the 16. Armee to withdraw from the pocket. Thus, the Germans began to withdraw just as Timoshenko opened his grand offensive to cut them off and destroy almost 100,000 German troops. This volume will conclude with the drama of a German army-size withdrawal under fire in winter, under attack from three sides.</p></p><p>This volume covers both the Battle of the Demyansk Pocket and the Siege of Kholm, during the period of January 1942 to February 1943.

It is an area of great contrasts -- geographically beautiful, yet the underlying crust of the region is cracked along great tectonic fault lines. These natural fault lines pale in comparison to the borders made by man, which have added further layers of complexity to a region where war is frequent, horrors are unspeakable, and history is unfathomable. It is not an area of the world that many would care to visit -- unless they had been there before.</p><p>Simon Winchester, a seasoned reporter, visited the region twenty years ago. During the recent Kosovo crisis, he remembered that first trip and the people he met, and he decided that parallel journeys might well be a device for explaining with sympathy the true nature of this fractured region. Two great capitals, Vienna and Istanbul, whose ceaseless imperial rivalries in the past played so profound a role in shaping the savage divisions of the region today, would anchor his second journey to the region.</p><p>With the war under way, he enlisted the aid of a linguist friend and set off from Vienna on a long, scimitar-shaped adventure through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo, Bulgaria, and Turkey, arriving at the Golden Horn just as the war was officially declared over. With luck, and through valuable personal contacts, Winchester managed to be in Macedonia on the day the NATO forces moved in to assume control of Kosovo -- and because the commanding general was an old friend, he rode in with the liberating columns of troops and armor.</p><p>This is not a book about the war, but rather an intimate portrait of the region painted while the war was going on. It is also an attempt to understand what has led this region to violence -- now, in the past, and inevitably again in the future. Written with a keen sense of time and place,&nbsp;<em>The Fracture Zone</em>&nbsp;is at once current and timeless. It goes behind the headlines and gives us a true picture of a region that has always been on the brink. Simon Winchester's remarkable journey puts all the elements together -- the faults, the fractures, and the chaos -- and makes sense out of a seemingly senseless place.</p></p><p>Simon Winchester, a British newspaper reporter for 30 years and the author of 13 books (including <i>The Professor and the Madman</i>), has turned his attention to the Balkans, an area he visited years ago on a road trip from Vienna to Istanbul--a journey he retraced in the spring of 1999. <i>The Fracture Zone</i> describes both of those trips, concentrating on the history and character of the region more than the recent war and its aftermath. Winchester has spent most of his career as a foreign correspondent, but his more recent occupations as historian and a writer for <i>Cond� Nast Traveler</i> are in evidence here. Winchester's angle on the Balkans is unique and well written: those who have been bewildered at best and bored at worst by the Balkan conflict may find that <i>The Fracture Zone</i> captures their interest better than hundreds of news accounts of war atrocities. "Why is there, and seemingly always has been, this dire inevitability about the Balkans being so fractious and unsettled a corner of the world?" Winchester wonders aloud. That eternal question continues to plague world statesmen and, though not fully answered here, affords the opportunity for an interesting exploration.<p><strong>A True Portrait of One of the World's Most Chaotic and Beautiful Regions That Explains Why Violence Has Always Occurred There--And Why It May Continue For Years To Come</strong></p><p>The vast and mountainous area that makes up the Balkans is rife with discord, both cultural and topographical. And, as Simon Winchester superbly demonstrates in this intimate portrait of the region, much of the political strife of the past century can be traced to its inherent contrasts. With the aid of a guide and linguist, Winchester traveled deep into the region's most troublesome areas--including Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, and Turkey--just as the war was tearing these countries apart. The result is a book not just about war but also about how war affects the living. Both timeless and current, <em>The Fracture Zone</em> goes behind the headlines to offer a true picture of a region that has always been on the brink. Winchester's remarkable journey puts all the elements together--the faults, the fractures, and the chaos--to make sense out of a seemingly senseless place.</p></p><h2>Good Ideas from Questionable Christians and Outright Pagans: An Introduction to Key Thinkers and Philosophies</h2><p>"What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What concord is there between the Academy and the church?" (Tertullian, 3rd century). Such skepticism about the place of philosophy in the life of Christians persists down through the ages. As a student, author Steve Wilkens had deep reservations about studying the works of "pagans" or even "questionable Christians." Now a teacher at a Christian university, Wilkens has developed a deep appreciation for teaching and studying philosophy. In fact, he believes that the life of faith can be enriched by good philosophical reflection. In this book Wilkens helps you begin the same journey. Using generous quotations from the original sources, Wilkens provides an introduction to the study of philosophy by exploring a single key issue from each of the following philosophers: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche and Sartre. The questions considered include <ul><li>Why ask why?</li><li>Is a just society possible?</li><li>Is God responsible for evil?</li><li>Can you be certain of anything?</li><li>Is morality all about power? </li><li>Do you really want to be free?</li></ul> Wilkens encourages you not to be a mere spectator but to actively and critically engage the questions and ideas these philosophers raise. Here is a book for beginning students, thoughtful Christians or anyone who wants to explore life's deepest questions.</p><p>Steve Wilkens (PhD, Fuller Theological Seminary) is professor of philosophy and ethics at Azusa Pacific University. His books include <em>Hidden Worldviews</em>, <em>Faith and Reason: Three Views</em>, <em>Christianity Western Thought</em> (volumes 2 and 3) and <em>Beyond Bumper Sticker Ethics</em>. He has also taught as an adjunct faculty member at Mount San Antonio College, Glendale Community College, Fuller Theological Seminary and Azusa Pacific University's C. P. Haggard Graduate School of Theology."Steve Wilkens reliably and accessibly communicates the views of some of the great philosophers and distills their sober and sound wisdom for Christians. A healthy antidote to all who believe that their own theologies have cornered the market on truth." (Kelly James Clark, Professor of Philosophy, Calvin College, and author of Philosophers Who Believe)<br><br>"Anyone who wonders whether philosophers might actually have something to teach Christians should read this book. Wilkens does a masterful job of clearly explaining some of the most influential philosophers, carefully unpacking the implications of their thought, and evenhandedly assessing their respective strengths and weaknesses. And ultimately, he demonstrates that each of these philosophers does indeed have something to teach us."

Set between 1950 and 1963, Joe Bageant uses Maw, Pap, Ony Mae, and other members of his rambunctious Scots&#x2013;Irish family to chronicle the often-heartbreaking post-war journey of 22 million rural Americans into the cities, where they became the foundation of a permanent white underclass. </p><p>Combining recollection, stories, accounts, remembrance, and analysis, the book offers an intimate look at what Americans lost in the massive and orchestrated post-war social and economic shift from an agricultural to an urban consumer society. Along the way, he also provides insights into how &#x2018;the second and third generation of displaced agrarians&#x2019;, as Gore Vidal described them, now fuel the discontent of America&#x2019;s politically conservative, God-fearing, Obama-hating &#x2018;red-staters&#x2019;. </p><p>These are the gun-owning, uninsured, underemployed white tribes inhabiting America&#x2019;s urban and suburban heartland: the ones who never got a slice of the pie during the good times, and the ones hit hardest by America&#x2019;s bad times, and who hit back during election years. Their &#x2018;tough work and tougher luck&#x2019; story stretches over generations, and Bageant tells it here with poignancy, indignation, and tinder-dry wit.</p></p><p><p>Joe Bageant frequently appeared on US National Public Radio and the BBC, and wrote for newspapers and magazines internationally. He was a commentator on the politics of class in America, and his book <i>Deer Hunting with Jesus: dispatches from America&#x2019;s class war</i> has been adapted for the theatre. He also wrote an online column (www.joebageant.com) that has made him a cult hero among gonzo-journalism junkies and progressives. Joe&#x2019;s second book, <i>Rainbow Pie: a redneck memoir</i>, was published in the United States four days after he died in March 2011.</p><p>&#x201c;Taken together, Bageant's two books provide salutary, hilarious and at times harrowing reading, with more than a few lessons of caution for Australia. Compassionate and brilliantly written.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Adelaide Review</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;The theme that runs through this memoir and portrait of one aspect of American social life in the postwar years, is the evolution of the white underclass. After World War II, Americans were sold the myth of endless prosperity, when, Joe Bageant maintains, the reality was that more than 20 million migrated from rural America (shrinking the farming population from 44 per cent to 5 per cent) and became the unacknowledged white poor of America. This is their tale, told by one who was there. And it is told with great compassion, in simple, clear prose that has the immediacy of speech...Shades of Studs Terkel.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b><i>The Age</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;...we get to hear the voice of the American underclass...Bageant may write like a dream but he hasn't forgotten where he came from...Cutting through the corporatist flim-flam, Bageant describes just what trouble America is in.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>Simon Hughes, <i>Australian Financial Review Magazine</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Equal parts social commentary and evocative memoir, this book exposes the vast and growing inequity between the economic mismanagers and the working poor in the US...Don't presume this is in any way dour soapboxery: Bageant is an effortless humourist. And his reminiscences lead to moments of sheer literary pleasure.&#x201d; <b>FOUR STARS</b> <br>&#x2015;<b>Melissa Cranenburgh, <i>Big Issue</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;For all of its bitterness, the book is lifted by Bageant's unique and personable voice. Even in the darkest chapters, it retains a folksy charm and an admirably black wit. It's rare for such a downer of a book to make the reader grin so often.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Courier Mail</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Illuminating and frequently touching...Bageant just wants us to think. To remember. To lift the veil of collective amnesia. To see.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>Stephen Webb, <i>Insights</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Joe Bageant has a wonderful ability to embed hard social, political and economic facts into the warp and weft of stories of homespun characters, close to the earth they plow that speaks thru them.</p> <p>It's not true that a good book is one you &#x201c;can't put it down.&#x201d; I put down <i>Rainbow Pie</i> several times &#x2015; sometimes even on a page&#x2015;to savor the language and admire the skyline, and dig deep into the loam of characters, marvel at the panoply of facts marshalled along the way.</p> <p><i>Rainbow Pie</i> is touching in the way that Thoreau touches us, in its ideas about place and &#x201c;abidance,&#x201d; natural and superficial worlds.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>Gary Corseri, Literary scholar, arts critic Salon.com, Counterpunch.com</b></p> <p>&#x201c;Joe Bageant doesn&#x2019;t mince his words in this angry requiem for the dignity of the white US working classes. Subtitled <i>A Memoir Of Redneck America</i>, <i>Rainbow Pie</i> is a terse, provocative book...As the midterm elections approach and a solid proportion of the US &#x201c;middle class&#x201d; seems to be gearing up to vote for the sort of lurid right-wingers that baffle even conservative Europeans, Bageant offers some plausible suggestions as to why things have come to this.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>Andrzej Lukowski, <i>Metro</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;With humour, compassion and rage, he explores plight of America's white &#x201c;redneck&#x201d; underclass.&#x201d; <b>FOUR STARS</b> <br>&#x2015;<b><i>MX</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;This is a deeply felt memoir, written by a man who loves his country, is proud of its past and fears for its future. It is intensely readable and more than a little disturbing.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>David Christie, <i>Newcastle Herald</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Bageant is a US social commentator with a unique angle&#x2015;he was born a redneck, in rural America. Now he is a middle-class intellectual and an acerbic commentator on his beloved land. He became famous with <i>Deer Hunting With Jesus</i>, an analysis of poor, white, conservative Americans that was written with Steinbeck-like compassion and observation. He saw his subjects as victims of rabid capitalism and evangelical religion. <i>Rainbow Pie</i> continues in this vein, a memoir of his family...A powerful book.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Sunday Age</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;[<i>Rainbow Pie</i> is] more an essay on political economy, lavishly illustrated with anecdotes from five generations of his own family, than a life story.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Sunday Tasmanian</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Most Australians look upon the US with wide-eyed bewilderment. Why do Americans think public healthcare will lead to death panels? How did they ever believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the attack on the World Trade Centre? What craziness leads so many to believe Barack Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim? Why, over and over again, do they appear to fight against their own best interests? If you want answers to these questions then this dissection of the US's "white underclass" is superbly insightful.&#x201d; <b>PICK OF THE WEEK</b> <br>&#x2015;<b>Bruce Elder, <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;An amazing read.

But everything I know about poetry. All my tips and tricks and woes and worries are going to come tumbling out before you. I&#x2019;m going to divulge them. What a juicy word that is, &#x201c;divulge.&#x201d; Truth opening its petals. Truth smells like Chinese food and sweat.</p><p>What is poetry? Poetry is prose in slow motion. Now, that isn&#x2019;t true of rhymed poems. It&#x2019;s not true of Sir Walter Scott. It&#x2019;s not true of Longfellow, or Tennyson, or Swinburne, or Yeats. Rhymed poems are different. But the kind of free-verse poems that most poets write now&#x2014;the kind that I write&#x2014;is slow-motion prose.</p><p>My life is a lie. My career is a joke. I&#x2019;m a study in failure. Obviously I&#x2019;m up in the barn again&#x2014;which sounds like a country song, except for the word &#x201c;obviously.&#x201d; I wonder how often the word &#x201c;obviously&#x201d; has been used in a country song. Probably not much, but I don&#x2019;t know because I hardly listen to country, although some of the folk music I like has a strong country tincture. Check out Slaid Cleaves, who lives in Texas now but grew up right near where I live.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>SO I&#x2019;M UP in the second floor of the barn, where it&#x2019;s very empty, and I&#x2019;m sitting in what&#x2019;s known as a shaft of light. The light leans in from a high window. I want to adjust my seat so I can slant my face totally into the light. Just ease it into the light. That&#x2019;s it. If this barn were a prison cell, this would be the moment of the day that I would look forward to. Sitting here in the long womanly arm of light, the arm that reaches down like Anne Boleyn&#x2019;s arm reaching down from her spotlit height. Not Anne Boleyn. Who am I thinking of? Margot Fonteyn, the ballet dancer. I knew there was a Y in there.</p><p>There&#x2019;s one droopy-bottomed wasp diving back and forth, having some fun with what&#x2019;s available. I can move my head a certain way, and I feel the sun warming up the clear flamingos that swim around in my eyeballs. My corneas are making infinity symbols under their orange-flavored lids.</p><p>I can even do eyelid wars. Do you do that? Where you try as hard as you can to look up with your eyeballs, rolling them back in your head, but with your eyes closed. Your eyelids will keep pulling your eyes back down because of the interlock between the two sets of muscles. Try it. It&#x2019;s a good way of passing the time.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t chirp at me, ye birdies! I&#x2019;ve had enough of that kind of chirpage. It cuts no grease with me.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>WHEN I COME across a scrap of poetry I like, I make up a tune for it. I&#x2019;ve been doing this a lot lately. For instance, here&#x2019;s a stanza by Sir Walter Scott. I&#x2019;ll sing it for you. &#x201c;We heard you in our twilight caves&#x2014;&#x201d; Try it again.</p><p>It&#x2019;s written in what&#x2019;s called a ballad stanza. Four lines, four beats in each line, and the third line drives toward the fourth. Notes of joy can <i>pierce</i> the waves, Sir Walter says. In other words, notes of joy can cut through the mufflement. Notes of joy have a special STP solvent in them that dissolves all the gluey engine deposits of heartache. War and woe don&#x2019;t have anything like the range and reach that notes of joy do.</p><p>And yes, of course, there are things that should be said about iambic pentameter, and I don&#x2019;t want to lose sight of that. I don&#x2019;t want to slight &#x201c;the longer line.&#x201d; I hope we can get to that fairly soon. My theory&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t resist giving you a little glimpse of it here&#x2014;my theory is that iambic pentameter is in actuality a waltz. It&#x2019;s not five-beat rhythm, even though &#x201c;pent&#x201d; means five, because five beats would be totally off-kilter and ridiculous and would never work and would be a complete disaster and totally unlistenable. Pentameter, so called, if you listen to it with an open ear, is a slow kind of gently swaying three-beat minuetto. Really, I mean it.</p><p>And what romanticism did was to set the pentameter minuet aside and try to recover the older, more basic ballad rhythm. Somewhere along the way, so the Romantic poets felt, the humanness and the singingness and the amblingness of lyric poetry became entangled in frippery and parasols, and that&#x2019;s because we stopped hearing those four basic pacing beats. That&#x2019;s what Walter Scott was bringing back when he published his border ballads, and what Coleridge was bringing back when he wrote the Kubla Khan song and &#x201c;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&#x201d; They were bringing back the ballad. &#x201c;Where Alph, the sacred river ran&#x201d;&#x2014;four beats. &#x201c;Through caverns measureless to man&#x201d;&#x2014;four beats. And it&#x2019;s the basis of song lyrics, too, because lyric poetry <i>is</i> song lyrics, that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s called lyric poetry.</p><p>And you know? I&#x2019;ve read too many difficult poems. I&#x2019;ve postponed comprehension too many times. And I&#x2019;ve written difficult poems, too. No more.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>YOU&#x2019;RE OUT THERE. I&#x2019;m out here. I&#x2019;m sitting in the sandy driveway on my white plastic chair. There&#x2019;s a man somewhere in Europe who is accumulating a little flotsam heap of knowledge about the white plastic chair. He calls it the &#x201c;monobloc&#x201d; chair. A word I&#x2019;ve never used. Monobloc, no K. And I&#x2019;m sitting in one. Its arms are blindingly white in the sun.</p><p>His name is Jens Thiel. God, I love Europeans. Jens. Especially the ones from smaller countries. Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. I love those places. And of course: Amsterdam. What a great name for a city. Paul Oakenfold has a piece of trance music called &#x201c;Amsterdam.&#x201d; His name is Paul, and my name is Paul. Paul: What is that crazy U doing there? Paw&#x2014;U&#x2014;L.</p><p>A woman is walking by on the street. Ah, it&#x2019;s Nanette, my neighbor. I knew it was her. She&#x2019;s carrying a garbage bag. She&#x2019;s picking up trash, I guess. Nan does that. She has an early-morning stroll sometimes, and I&#x2019;ve noticed she takes along an empty trash bag tucked into her back pocket. I&#x2019;m going to wave to her. Hi! Hello! She waved back.</p><p>Yes, she&#x2019;s picking up a beer can and shaking it out, and now she&#x2019;s putting it in that trash bag. The beer can is faded to a pale violet color. I think I can almost hear the soft rustle of the bag as things fall into it. Pfft. Pfft. Sometimes maybe a clink.</p><p>Nan is or soon will be divorced from her husband, Tom&#x2014;Tom, who every weekend went windsurfing in a blue-armed wetsuit. She has a son named Raymond, a good kid who plays lacrosse. And she now evidently has a new boyfriend, a curly-haired man named Chuck, annoyingly handsome.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>OF COURSE YOU already understand meter. When you hear it, you understand it, you just don&#x2019;t know you understand it. You, as a casual reader of poems, and as a casual listener to pop songs, understand meter better than the metrists who misdescribed it over several centuries understood it. Even they understood it better than they knew.</p><p>My neighbor Nan seems to be fully committed to her new flame, Chuck. His car is in the driveway again. I suppose that&#x2019;s a good thing. She deserves to be happy with a good-looking man like Chuck.</p><p>Roz, the woman who lived with me in this house for eight years, has moved away.</p><p>My dog is shedding because it&#x2019;s summer, and then the birds, that keep chirping and chirping, make nests of the dog hair. It&#x2019;s good for that.</p><p>I wish I could smoke pot. What would that do? I don&#x2019;t even know where I would get pot around here. Somebody said the wispy dude with the pointy sideburns who works at the pet-food store. Could I maybe offer some to Roz, as a dramatic gesture? I&#x2019;ve never bought pot in my life. Maybe it&#x2019;s time. No, I don&#x2019;t think it is. Too involved. But I think I will step in from the driveway for a moment to get a clear glass bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale. I do love a palate cleanser of pure Newcastle Brown.</p><p>Roz is kind of short. I&#x2019;ve always been attracted to short women. They&#x2019;re usually smarter and more interesting than tall women and yet people don&#x2019;t take them as seriously. And it&#x2019;s a bosomy kind of generous smartness, often. But she&#x2019;s moved out, so I should stop talking about her.</p><p>I&#x2019;m a little sick of all the bird chirping, frankly. They just don&#x2019;t stop. I mowed the lawn yesterday so I wouldn&#x2019;t have to hear their racket. &#x201c;Chirtle chirtle.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s constant. And as soon as I started mowing I knew this was the best thing I could be doing. Walking behind this armful of noise, going around, turning the corner I&#x2019;d already turned, circumventing the overturned canoe. I ducked under the clothesline that Roz strung last year between the barn and the box elder tree. The white rope is now a lovely dry gray color. She used to hang many beautiful tablecloths and dishtowels on that clothesline. I should use it myself, instead of the dryer, which is making a thumping noise anyway, and then if she drove by she&#x2019;d see that I was being a responsible person who dried my clothes in the sun. I wish I&#x2019;d taken a picture of that clothesline with her faded shirts on it. No bras that I remember, but you can&#x2019;t expect bras necessarily on a clothesline. You have to go to Target to see bras hanging nobly out for the public gaze.</p><p>I got in bed last night and I closed my eyes and I lay there and then a powerful urge came over me to cross my eyes. I thought of tragic people like Don Rickles, Red Skelton, people like that. Broken professional entertainers who maybe once had been funny. And now they were in Vegas, on cruise control, using their eye-crossing to allude to their early period of genuine funniness. Or they were dead.</p><p>So I crossed my eyes with my eyes closed. And I saw something in the dark: two crescent moons on the outside of my vision, which were the new moons of strain. I could feel my corneal pleasure domes moving, too. And as my eyes reached maximum crossing I felt an interesting blind pain of wrongness. I decided that I should hold on to that.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>SO NOW, YOU&#x2019;RE WAITING. I&#x2019;ve promised something. You&#x2019;re thinking okay, he&#x2019;s said he&#x2019;s going to divulge. Your hope is that I, Paul Chowder, have some things that I know that you don&#x2019;t know because I have been a published poet for a while. And maybe I do know a few things.</p><p>One useful tip I can pass on is: Copy poems out. Absolutely top priority. Memorize them if you want to, but the main thing is to copy them out. Get a notebook and a ballpoint pen and copy them out. You will be shocked by how much this helps you. You will see immediate results in your very next poem, I promise.</p><p>Another tip is: If you have something to say, say it. Don&#x2019;t save it up. Don&#x2019;t think to yourself, I&#x2019;m going to build up to the truth I really want to say. Don&#x2019;t think, In this poem, I&#x2019;m going to be sneaky and start with this other truth over here, and then I&#x2019;m going to scamper around a little bit over here, and then play with some purple Sculpey over here in the corner, and finally I&#x2019;ll reach the truth at the very end. No, slam it in immediately. It won&#x2019;t work if you hold it in reserve. Begin by saying what you actually care about saying, and the saying of it will guide you to the next line, and the next, and the next. If you need to arrange things differently later, you can do that.</p><p>And never think, Oh, heck, I&#x2019;ll write that whole poem later. Never think, First I&#x2019;ll write this poem about my old orange life jacket, so that I&#x2019;ll be more ready to confront the more haunting, daunting reality of this poem here about the treehouse that was rejected by its tree. No. If you do, the bigger theme will rebel and go sour on you. It&#x2019;ll hang there like a forgotten chili pepper on the stem. Put it down, work on it, finish it. If you don&#x2019;t get on it now, somebody else will do something similar, and when you crack open next year&#x2019;s <i>Best American Poetry</i> and see it under somebody else&#x2019;s name you&#x2019;ll hate yourself.</p><p>Another tip: The term &#x201c;iambic pentameter&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t good. It isn&#x2019;t at all good. It&#x2019;s the source of much grief and muddle and some very bad enjambments. Louise Bogan once said that somebody&#x2019;s enjambments gave her the willies, and she&#x2019;s right, they can do that to you. You shudder, reading them. Most iambic-pentameter enjambments are a mistake. That sounds technical but I&#x2019;m talking about something real&#x2014;a real problem.</p><p>And finally, the really important thing you have to know is: The four-beat line is the soul of English poetry.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>PEOPLE ARE GOING to feed you all kinds of oyster crackers about iambic pentameter. They&#x2019;re going to say, Oh ho ho, iambic pentameter! The centrality of the five-stress line! Because &#x201c;pent&#x201d; is five in Babylonian, and five is the number of fingers on your hand, and five is the number of slices of American cheese you can eat in one sitting. They&#x2019;re going to talk to you about Chaucer and about blank verse&#x2014;which is another confusing term&#x2014;and all this so-called prosody they&#x2019;re going to shovel at you. And sure&#x2014;fine&#x2014;you can handle it. You&#x2019;re up to whatever mind-forged shrivelments they&#x2019;re going to dish out that day. But just remember (a) that the word &#x201c;prosody&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t an appealing word, and (b) that pentameter came <i>later on.</i> Pentameter is secondary. Pentameter is an import from France. And French is a whole different language. The real basis of English poetry is this walking rhythm right here.</p><p>Woops&#x2014;dropped my Sharpie.</p><p>Right here: One&#x2014;two&#x2014;three&#x2014;four. &#x201c;Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill. We think so then, we thought so still.&#x201d; I think that was the very first poem I heard, &#x201c;The Pelican Chorus,&#x201d; by Edward Lear. My mom read it to me. God, it was beautiful. Still is. Those singing pelicans. They slapped their feet around on those long bare islands of yellow sand, and they swapped their verb tenses so that then was still and still was then. They were the first to give me the shudder, the shiver, the grieving joy of true poetry&#x2014;the feeling that something wasn&#x2019;t right, but it was all right that it wasn&#x2019;t right. In fact it was better than if it had been right.</p><p>In the middle of the night</p><p>Miss Clavel turns on the light</p><p>Hear that? Another four-beat line. My mother read that one to me, too. And &#x201c;Johnny Crow&#x2019;s Garden.&#x201d; And A. A. Milne and his snail and his brick. Milne was a metrical genius. And Dr. Seuss, of course, the great Ted Geisel. Who probably was, if I really want to be truthful and honest&#x2014;and I do, of course&#x2014;the poet most important to me until I was about twelve. You remember the little intense guy with the hat on, who&#x2019;s on his stool in the Plexiglas dome, counting the people all over the world who are going to sleep?</p><p>And it scans. &#x201c;Two Biffer-Baum birds are now building their nest.&#x201d; It rhymes&#x2014;it relies a fair amount on silly proper names, but it rhymes&#x2014;and it scans perfectly. Dr. Seuss was a stickler for scansion. He was part of a lineage that runs back through <i>Punch</i> and Lear and Gilbert and Sullivan and Lewis Carroll and Barham&#x2019;s <i>Ingoldsby Legends.</i> He uses the four-beat line in the great old way. In fact, I&#x2019;d say almost all the poems that I heard as a child were classic four-beat lines.</p><p>Hell, let&#x2019;s get into it. Where&#x2019;s my Sharpie again? Okay:</p><p>See those four numbers? Those are the four beats. Four stresses, as we say in the meter business. Tetrameter. Four. &#x201c;Tetra&#x201d; is four. Like Tetris, that computer game where the squares come down relentlessly and overwhelm your mind with their crude geometry and make you peck at the arrow keys like some mindless experimental chicken and hurry and panic and finally you turn your computer off. And you sit there think...</p></p><h2>Rocks from Space: Meteorites and Meteorite Hunters (Astronomy)</h2><p>This popular nontechnical introduction to the fascinating world of meteorites, asteroids, comets, and impact craters is now even better! With more than 50 new photographs and updated illustrations, new and expanded appendixes, and some fun cosmic humor, <i>Rocks from Space, Second Edition</i>, journeys into the last frontier for close-up looks at the latest astronomical discoveries. Relive the thrill of seeing Comet Hale-Bopp as it streaked through the dark sky. Watch Pathfinder bump its way across the surface of Mars--while you ponder whether life really exists on the red planet. View photos of the impact scar--twice the size of Earth-where Comet Shoemaker/Levy collided with Jupiter. And learn the latest on meteorite chemistry and classification.</p><p>O. Richard Norton is former director of the Grace Flandrau Planetarium and Science Center at the University of Arizona and the Fleischmann Planetarium at the University of Nevada at Reno. He studied meteorites under world-renowned meteoriticist Frederick C. Leonard. Norton taught astronomy at Central Oregon Community College and served as president of Science Graphics, a company that produces instructional science slides for use in college and university classrooms.Astronomy abounds with amateurs, and the easiest entr&#x201a;e to the hobby is meteor watching. Anyone can see a few shooting stars on any night. For nighthawks and insomniacs, then, Norton offers this quaint miscellany crammed with facts and stories about extraterrestrial rocks, along with 200 photos. "Falls," as Norton calls the pieces that reach the ground, exert great scientific interest, so he describes past expeditions to collect them and examine the ancient craters they gouged out. Meteoriticist H. H. Nininger was one such explorer, and his life, which culminated in running a commercial meteor museum, illustrates the obsessive enthusiasm the hobby can induce. Although a field book might be more authoritative, Norton's tome will help slake the curiosity and worries that surround cosmic collisions, especially so soon after a comet hit Jupiter last month. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Stamp Stencil Paint: Making Extraordinary Patterned Projects by Hand</h2><p>Textile artist Anna Joyce&#x2019;s design process is intuitive, relaxed, and rooted in the belief that we should live with color and pattern every day.

They have begun to perceive embodiment as dynamic rather than static, as experiences that vary over time and across the world as they are shaped by discourses, institutions, practices, technologies, and ideologies. What has emerged is a multiplicity of bodies, inviting a great many disciplinary points of view and modes of interpretation. The forty-seven readings presented in this volume range from classic works of social theory, history, and ethnography to more recent investigations into historical and contemporary modes of embodiment.<p></p><p><i>Beyond the Body Proper</i> includes nine sections conceptually organized around themes such as everyday life, sex and gender, and science. Each section is preceded by interpretive commentary by the volume&#x2019;s editors. Within the collection are articles and book excerpts focused on bodies using tools and participating in rituals, on bodies walking and eating, and on the female circumcision controversy, as well as pieces on medical classifications, spirit possession, the commodification of body parts, in vitro fertilization, and an artist/anatomist&#x2019;s &#x201c;plastination&#x201d; of cadavers for display. Materialist, phenomenological, and feminist perspectives on embodiment appear along with writings on interpretations of pain and the changing meanings of sexual intercourse. Essays on these topics and many others challenge Eurocentric assumptions about the body as they speak to each other and to the most influential contemporary trends in the human sciences.</p><p>With selections by: Henry Abelove, Walter Benjamin, Janice Boddy, John Boswell, Judith Butler, Caroline Walker Bynum, Stuart Cosgrove, Michel de Certeau, Gilles Deleuze, Alice Domurat Dreger, Barbara Duden, Friedrich Engels, E.

This one law so dramatically altered American society that, looking back, it seems preordained-as Everett Dirksen, the GOP leader in the Senate and a key supporter of the bill, said, &#x201c;no force is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.&#x201d; But there was nothing predestined about the victory: a phalanx of powerful senators, pledging to &#x201c;fight to the death&#x201d; for segregation, launched the longest filibuster in American history to defeat it. </p><p>The bill's passage has often been credited to the political leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, or the moral force of Martin Luther King. Yet as Clay Risen shows, the battle for the Civil Rights Act was a story much bigger than those two men. It was a broad, epic struggle, a sweeping tale of unceasing grassroots activism, ringing speeches, backroom deal-making and finally, hand-to-hand legislative combat. The larger-than-life cast of characters ranges from Senate lions like Mike Mansfield and Strom Thurmond to NAACP lobbyist Charles Mitchell, called &#x201c;the 101st senator&#x201d; for his Capitol Hill clout, and industrialist J. Irwin Miller, who helped mobilize a powerful religious coalition for the bill. The "idea whose time had come" would never have arrived without pressure from the streets and shrewd leadership in Congress--all captured in Risen's vivid narrative. </p><p>This critical turning point in American history has never been thoroughly explored in a full-length account. Now, <i>New York Times</i> editor and acclaimed author Clay Risen delivers the full story, in all its complexity and drama.</p></p><p><b>Clay Risen</b> is a staff editor of the <i>New York Times</i> op-ed and Sunday Review section and founded the noted quarterly <i>Democracy: A Journal of Ideas</i>, of which he served as managing editor. His recent writing has appeared in such journals as the<i> Atlantic</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, and the<i> Washington Post</i>. His first book, <i>A Nation on Fire: America in the Wake of the King Assassination </i>(Wiley, 2009), received much critical acclaim. He lives in New York.So here&#x2019;s the thing: when most of us think about the 1964 Civil Rights Act, we think about two people: President Lyndon Johnson, who was instrumental in moving the act through Congress, and Martin Luther King Jr., who stirred the public&#x2019;s passion and moral conscience and helped break down the long-standing resistance to equal-rights legislation. The actual story, Risen writes in this insightful book, is a bit more complex. Yes, Johnson and King were key players in the passage of the bill, but they were not the only ones; the efforts of a variety of people, including religious leaders and politicians, civil rights leaders, even union leaders, should not be forgotten. As Risen says: The Civil Rights Act is often explained like a one-man play, when in fact it had a cast of, literally, thousands. The author explores the years leading up to the 1964 bill, including the creation of earlier civil rights acts (such as, for example, the 1957 civil rights act, which then senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson worked to whittle the bill to a nub before allowing it to pass) and John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s efforts to create stronger and more comprehensive legislation (in part due to violent response around the country to earlier anti-discrimination legislation). The book is about a massively influential civil rights act, to be sure, but it&#x2019;s also about the many people who worked hard to set the stage for its passing . . . people who, as the author rightly points out, have been moved to the historical background, while the roles of Johnson and King have been inflated in the public&#x2019;s memories. --David Pitt</p><h2>Wild Ones, Vol. 10 (10)</h2><p>Is she too hot to handle, even for the yakuza?Even wild ones fall in love.<br><br>Reads R to L (Japanese Style).

One of the initiators of surrealism, he is a key figure in modern art; his influence on later painters, particularly during his "metaphysical" period, is vast. De Chirico relied on imagery from the unconscious to create art with mythological, philosophical, and historical overtones, so that his paintings have an appeal that is more that purely visual.<br></p><p>The self-portrait that emerges in these pages is, like de Chirico&#39;s early canvases, a projection of the obsessions and inner conflicts of an artist of unequivocal integrity, who, gradually insulating himself from crumbling values, became convinced of his own creative supremacy at the center of the universe.<b>Giorgio de Chirico</b> (1888-1978) was an Italian artist and writer. In the years before World War I, he founded the scuola metafisica art movement, which profoundly influenced the surrealists.</p><h2>The Working Guide to Traditional Small-Boat Sails: A How-To Handbook for Owners and Builders</h2><p>A revised edition, with a new chapter on sailmaking.

In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics.<br><br>While some documents from Vatican II, like <i>Gaudium et spes</i> ("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality. <i>The Sexual Person</i> draws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human. This daring and potentially revolutionary book will be sure to provoke constructive dialogue among theologians, and between theologians and the Magisterium.</p><p><b>Todd A. Salzman</b> is a professor of Catholic theology and chair of the Department of Theology at Creighton University. He is the coeditor of <i>Marriage in the Catholic Tradition: Scripture, Tradition, and Experience</i> and author of <i>What Are They Saying about Roman Catholic Ethical Method?</i><br><br><b>Michael G. Lawler </b>is professor emeritus of Catholic theology at Creighton University. He is the author of <i>What Is and What Ought to Be: The Dialectic of Experience, Theology, and Church</i> and <i>Marriage and the Catholic Church: Disputed Questions.</i><p>"They cover the whole gamut of issues in sexual ethics in impressive and thoroughly scholarly detail. They are conversant with the results of a wide range of recent studies in sexual psychology; and this material is effectively integrated into a tight philosophical argument...it is very refreshing to read such a balanced treatment, controversial but not at all combative or defensive in tone. Their conclusions are thoroughly constructive and very convincing. Overall, it is a most impressive achievement."&#x2015;<i>The Way</i></p><p>"Todd Salzman and Michael Lawler's new book...is among the most important works in Catholic sexual ethics to emerge in the last two decades...Their book will be noticed because of its controversial positions on contraception, same-sex relationships, cohabitation and artificial means of reproduction. However, its contribution is its clear articulation of a person-centered natural-law ethic that offers Catholics an authentic way to think about sex in relation to their faith. "&#x2015;<i>National Catholic Reporter</i></p><p>"The present volume is their clearest and most detailed critical inquiry into sexual anthropology to date. The dialogue that this volume should generate between the authors and the advocates of the New Natural Law Theory will be very valuable."&#x2015;<i>Catholic Library World</i></p><p>"Salzman and Lawler have succeeded brilliantly in combining a rigorous historical-critical engagement of the Catholic moral tradition with a set of creative, forward-looking proposals ... Salzman and Lawler have written an engaging, well-researched book that handles extremely complicated and controversial questions in a nuanced and intellectually rigorous manner."&#x2015;<i>Theological Studies</i></p><p>"Stimulating reading for theologians and graduate students."&#x2015;<i>Religious Studies Review</i></p><p>"An unusually rich resource for a dialogue on sexual ethics among a diverse group of religious ethicists who seek more fruitfully to articulate how Christians are called to shape their sexual lives in the contemporary world."&#x2015;<i>Conversations in Religion and Theology</i></p><p>"[Salzman and Lawler] move among four foci: the Catholic tradition, the school they characterize as the "New Natural Law Theory," the Revisionist school, and their own constructive synthesis. The careful critiques of the three positions are worth the price of the book but their positive reconstruction (so often missing in critical works) is equally valuable. ... Their work has a carefully constructed base of historical and sociological analysis as well as the requisite theology. It is well researched, carefully documented and logically argued."&#x2015;<i>Horizons</i></p></p><h2>The Doctrine and Covenants Made Easier-Part 2: Section 43 through Section 93 (Gospel Studies)</h2><p>Better understand the Doctrine and Covenants with these user friendly, helpful guides.

Edited and with an Introduction by Franz Rottensteiner. Translated by Rottensteiner and others. A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book<br></p><p>Stanislaw Lem (1921-2006) was the most widely translated and best known science fiction author writing outside of the English language. Winner of the Kafka Prize, he was a contributor to many magazines, including the <i>New Yorker,</i> and the author of numerous works, including <i>Solaris.</i>Ten essays, 1971-83: ranging from autobiography through analyses of the underpinnings of sf to examinations of specific authors and works - delivered in thunderous yet calculated tones, and a welter of academic polysyllables. The autobiographical piece is most engaging and revealing - with Lem candidly discussing his upbringing, his Jewish heritage, the German and Russian occupations of Poland, his own sf. Elsewhere, he demonstrates his formidable intellect and his self-imposed conceptual limitations: he finds fiction without intellectual challenge boring (and has no patience with the notion of fiction as entertainment); in his view, sf works in which neither the objects nor the ideas have any basis in reality are merely "empty games." Later, however, Lem cogently discusses sf's various time-travel motifs - notwithstanding his previous denunciation of "empty games" where "impossible time-travel machines are used to point out impossible time-travel paradoxes." "The primary unsolved problem" of sf, he writes, is "the lack of a theoretical typology of its paradigmatic structures" - yet he fails to demonstrate why this lack is so damaging. On the incestuous nature of Western sf, he's devastating: "critiques are not produced independently, but are written by either the authors or the editors of anthologies, who evaluate each other's works." (He also blasts publishers and editors for camouflaging advertising as criticism.) For all these reasons, sf is trashy and apt to remain so. Moving on to specifics, Lem shows himself to be a penetrating but often arbitrary and petulant critic. Just about the only Western sf author he approves of (Ballard and Bradbury rate a maybe) is Philip K. Dick - who "tries to probe the neglected, latent, untouched, as-yet-unrealized potentialities of human existence." A. E. van Vogt's work is condemned as "stupid lies" without a shred of evidence or analysis; Borges, Lem determines, "has suffered from a lack of a free and rich imagination." He criticizes Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon for what Leto thinks Keyes' should have written; the Strugatsky brothers' Roadside Picnic - which Leto not only analyzes brilliantly, but finds enjoyable - comes in for similar treatment. Clearly, there's some ax-grinding going on. In sum: guaranteed to offend and provoke.

It made me feel as if I lived in a house with secrets woven into the walls.<br><br>One day, I imagined, I would unravel one of those secrets and the whole house would come down around me.<br><br>Just a thought.<br><br>But that is exactly what happened.<br><br>One day.<br><br><b>Chapter 1: The Love Trap</b><br><br>When I was a little girl, I believed that people could get what they wished for if they wished hard enough and long enough and were good enough, and although I'm fifteen now and long ago stopped believing in things like the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny, I never completely stopped believing there was something magical in the world around us. Somewhere, there were angels watching over us, considering our wishes and dreams and occasionally, when the time was right and we were deserving, they granted us a wish.<br><br>Daddy taught me this. When I was still small enough to sit comfortably on his muscular right forearm and be carried around like a little princess, he would tell me to close my eyes really tight and wish until I saw my angel nearby, her wings fluttering like a bumble bee.<br><br>Daddy said everyone had an angel assigned to him or her at birth, and the angels did all they could to get humans to believe. He told me that when we are very little it's much easier to believe in things that grown-ups would call imagination. That's why, when we're little, angels will appear before us sometimes. I think some of us hold on a little longer or a little harder to that world of make believe. Some of us are not afraid to admit we dream even though we're older. We really do make a wish when we break a chicken bone or blow out our birthday candles or see a shooting star, and we wait and hope, even expect that it will come true.<br><br>I did so much wishing as I grew up, I was sure my angel was overworked. I couldn't help it. I always wished my daddy didn't have to go down into the coal mines miles under the earth, away from the sun in damp, dark caverns of dust. Just like every other coal miner's child, I had played in the openings of the deserted old mines, and I couldn't begin to understand what it would be like going down deep and spending a whole day below the fresh air. But poor Daddy had to do it.<br><br>As long as I could remember, I wished we lived in a real house instead of a trailer, even though right next to us, living in their trailer, were Papa George and Mama Arlene, both of whom I loved dearly. When I wished for a house, I just added a little more and wished they would live in the house next to ours. We would both have real backyards and lawns and there would be big maple and oak trees. Papa George would help me with my fiddling. And when it rained hard, I wouldn't feel as if I were living in a tin drum. When the wind blew, I wouldn't fear being turned over and over while asleep in my bed.<br><br>My wish list went on and on. I imagined that if I ever took the time and wrote all the wishes down, the paper would stretch from one end of our trailer to the other.<br><br>I wished hard that Mommy wasn't so unhappy all the time. She complained about having to work in Francine's Salon, washing other women's hair and doing perms, even though everyone said she was an excellent hairdresser. She did enjoy the gossip and loved to listen to the wealthy women talk about their trips and the things they had bought. But she was like a little girl who could only look in the window at beautiful things, one who never got to buy any of them herself.<br><br>Even when she was sad, Mommy was beautiful. One of my most frequent wishes was that I would be as pretty as she was when I grew up. When I was younger, I would perch in her bedroom and watch her at her dressing table meticulously applying her makeup and brushing her hair. As she did so, she preached about the importance of beauty care and told me about all the women she knew who were attractive but neglected themselves and looked simply awful. She told me if you were born pretty, you had an obligation to look pretty whenever you were in public.<br><br>"That's why I spend so much time on my hair and my nails, and that's why I have to spend so much money on these special skin creams," she explained. She was always bringing home samples of shampoo and hair conditioners for me to use as well.<br><br>She brought home perfumed bath oils and would soak in our small tub for over an hour. I would wash her back or, when I was old enough to be trusted, polish her toenails while she manicured her fingernails. Occasionally, she did my toenails and styled my hair.<br><br>People said we looked more like sisters than mother and daughter. I had inherited her small facial features, especially her button nose, but my hair was a lighter shade of brown, hair the color of hay. Once, I asked her to dye my hair the same shade as hers, but she shook her head and told me to leave it be, that it was a pretty color. But I wasn't as confident about my looks as she was about hers, even though Daddy told me he rushed home from work because now he had two beautiful women at home waiting for him.<br><br>My daddy stood six foot three and weighed nearly one hundred and ninety pounds, all muscle from working in the mines so many years. Although there were times when he returned home after a very long day in the mines aching, and moving slowly, he didn't complain. When he set eyes on me, his face always burst out with happiness. No matter how tired those strong arms of his were, I could run into them and he'd lift me with ease into the air.<br><br>When I was little, I would anxiously wait for the sight of him lumbering up the chipped and cracked macadam that led from the mines to our home in Mineral Acres trailer park. Suddenly, his six feet three inches of height would lift that shock of light brown hair over the ridge and I would see him taking strides with those long legs. His face and hands would be streaked with coal dust. He looked like a soldier home from battle. Under his right arm, clutched like a football, was his lunch basket. He made his own sandwiches early in the morning because Mommy was always still asleep when he woke and got ready for work.<br><br>Sometimes, even before he reached the Mineral Acres gate after work, Daddy would lift his head and see me waving. Our trailer was close to the entrance and our front yard faced the road from Sewell. If he saw me, Daddy would speed up, swinging his coal miner's helmet like a flag. Until I was about twelve, I had to wait close to Papa George and Mama Arlene's trailer, because Mommy was usually not home from work yet herself. Many times, she would go someplace and not make it home in time for dinner. Usually, she went to Frankie's Bar and Grill with her co-workers and friends and listened to the juke box music. But Daddy was a very good cook and I got so I could do a lot of the cooking myself, too. He and I ended up eating alone more times than not.<br><br>Daddy didn't complain about Mommy's not being there. If I did, he urged me to be more understanding. "Your mother and I got married too young, Melody," he told me.<br><br>"But weren't you terribly in love, Daddy?" I had read <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and knew that if you were desperately in love, age didn't make a difference.<br><br>I told my best friend Alice Morgan that I would never marry anyone until I was so head-over-heels in love I couldn't breathe. She thought that was an exaggeration and I would probably fall in love many times before I was married.<br><br>Daddy's voice was wistful. "We were, but we didn't listen to older, wiser heads. We just ran off and eloped without thinking about the consequences. We were both very excited about it and didn't think hard about the future. It was easier for me. I was always more settled, but your mother soon felt she had missed out on things. She works in that beauty parlor and hears the rich ladies talking about their trips and their homes and she gets frustrated. We got to let her have some freedom so she doesn't feel trapped by all our love for her."<br><br>"How can love trap someone, Daddy?" I asked.<br><br>He smiled his wide, soft smile. When he did that, his green eyes always got a hazy, faraway glint. He'd lift his gaze from my face to a window or sometimes just a wall as if he were seeing images from the mysterious past float by. "Well...if you love someone as much as we love Mommy, you want her around you all the time. It's like having a beautiful bird in a cage. You're afraid to let the bird free and yet you know, it would sing a sweeter song if it were."<br><br>"Why doesn't she love us that much, too?" I demanded.<br><br>"She does, in her own way." He smiled. "Your mother's the prettiest woman in this town -- for miles and miles around it too -- and I know she feels wasted sometimes. That's a hard thing to live with, Melody. People are always coming up to her and telling her she should be in the movies or on television or a model. She thinks time's flying by and soon it will be too late for her to be anything else but my wife and your mother."<br><br>"I don't want her to be anything else, Daddy."<br><br>"I know. She's enough for us. We're grateful, but she's always been restless and impulsive. She still has big dreams and one thing you never want to do to someone you love is kill her dreams.<br><br>"Of course," he continued, smiling, "I have every reason to believe you're going to be the celebrity in this family. Look how well Papa George has taught you to play the fiddle! And you can sing, too. You're growing into a beautiful young woman. Some talent scout's going to snap you up."<br><br>"Oh Daddy, that's silly. No talent scouts come to the mining towns looking for stars."<br><br>"So you'll go to college in New York City or in California," he predicted. "That's my dream. So don't go dumping dirt on top of it, Melody."<br><br>I laughed. I was too afraid to have such dreams for myself yet; I was too afraid of being frustrated and trapped like Mommy thought she now was.<br><br>I wondered why Daddy didn't feel trapped. No matter how hard things were, he would grin and bear it, and he never joined the other miners to drown his sorrows at the bar. He walked to and from work alone because the other miners lived in the shanties in town.<br><br>We lived in Sewell, which was a village born from the mine and built by the mining company in the lap of a small valley. Its main street had a church, a post office, a half dozen stores, two restaurants, a mortuary, and a movie theater open only on the weekends. The shanty homes were all the same pale brown color, built with board-and-batten siding and tar-paper roofs, but at least there were children my age there.<br><br>There were no other children near my age living in Mineral Acres trailer park. How I wished I had a brother or a sister to keep me company! When I told Mommy about that wish once, she grimaced and moaned that she was only a child herself when she had me.<br><br>"Barely nineteen! And it's not easy to bring children into the world. It's hard on your body and you have to worry about them getting sick and having enough to eat and having proper clothing, not to mention getting them an education. I rushed into motherhood. I should have waited."<br><br>"Then I would never have been born!" I complained.<br><br>"Of course you would have been born, but you would have been born when things were better and not so hard for us. We were right in the middle of a major change in our lives. It was very difficult."<br><br>Sometimes, she sounded as if she blamed me just for being born. It was as if she thought babies just floated around waiting to be conceived, and occasionally they got impatient and encouraged their parents to create them. That's what I had done.<br><br>I knew we had moved from Provincetown, Cape Cod, to Sewell in Monongalia County, West Virginia, before I was born, and we didn't have much at the time. Mommy did tell me that when they first arrived in Sewell as poor as they were, she was determined not to live in a shanty, so she and Daddy rented a mobile home in Mineral Acres, even though it was mostly populated by retired people like Papa George.<br><br>Papa George wasn't really my grandfather and Mama Arlene wasn't my real grandmother, but they were still like grandparents to me. Mama Arlene had often looked after me when I was a little girl. Papa George had been a coal miner and had retired on disability. He was suffering from black lung, which Daddy said was aggravated by his refusal to give up smoking. His illness made him look much older than his sixty-two years. His shoulders slumped, the lines in his pale, tired face were cut deep, and he was so thin Mama Arlene claimed she could weigh him down with a cable-knit sweater. Still, Papa George and I had the greatest of times when he helped teach me the fiddle.<br><br>He complained that it was Mama Arlene's nagging that wore him down. They always seemed to be bickering, but I didn't know any other two people as dedicated to each other as they were. Their arguments were never really mean either. They always ended up laughing.<br><br>Daddy loved talking with Papa George. On weekends especially, the two could often be found sitting in the rocking chairs on the cement patio under the metal awning, quietly discussing politics and the mining industry. Papa George was in Sewell during the violent times when the mining unions were being formed and he had lots of stories, which, according to Mama Arlene, were not fit for my ears.<br><br>"Why not?" he would protest.

This was no life for anyone.<br><br>I never understood why Daddy, who was brought up on Cape Cod in a fisherman's family, ended up working in a place where he was shut away from the sun and the sky all day. I knew he missed the ocean, yet we never returned to the Cape and we had nothing to do with Daddy's family. I didn't even know how many cousins I had, or their names, and I had never met or spoken to my grandparents. All I had ever seen was a faded black and white photograph of them with Daddy's father seated and his mother standing beside his father, both looking unhappy about being photographed. His father had a beard and looked as big as Daddy is now. His mother was wispy looking, but with hard, cold eyes.<br><br>The family in Provincetown was something Daddy didn't discuss. He would always change the subject, just saying, "We just had differences. It's better we're apart. It's easier this way."<br><br>I couldn't imagine why it was easier, but I saw it was painful for him to talk about it. Mommy never wanted to talk about it either. Just bringing up the family caused her to start crying and complaining to me that Daddy's family always thought little of her because she'd been an orphan. She told me she had been adopted by people who she said were too old to raise a child. They were both in their sixties when she was a teenager and they were very strict. She said she couldn't wait to get away from them.<br><br>I wanted to know more about them and about Daddy's family, too, but I was afraid it would start an argument between her and Daddy, so after a while, I just stopped asking questions.

The simply told story of a typical, grueling day of the titular character&#39;s life in a labor camp in Siberia, is a modern classic of Russian literature and quickly cemented Solzhenitsyn&#39;s international reputation upon publication in 1962. It is painfully apparent that Solzhenitsyn himself spent time in the gulags--he was imprisoned for nearly a decade as punishment for making derogatory statements about Stalin in a letter to a friend.From the icy blast of reveille through the sweet release of sleep, Ivan Denisovich endures. A common carpenter, he is one of millions viciously imprisoned for countless years on baseless charges, sentenced to the waking nightmares of the Soviet work camps in Siberia. Even in the face of degrading hatred, where life is reduced to a bowl of gruel and a rare cigarette, hope and dignity prevail. This powerful novel of fact is a scathing indictment of Communist tyranny, and an eloquent affirmation of the human spirit.</p><h2>Tina Barney</h2><p>Covering three decades of the artist&#x2019;s provocative yet intimate large-scale color images capturing the domestic life and private moments of the American and European elite&#x2014;her family and friends&#x2014;this book will appeal to contemporary-art lovers, photography book collectors, and anyone <br>with an interest in modern culture. <br> Internationally acclaimed American artist Tina Barney burst on the scene in the early 1980s with her provocative yet intimate photographs capturing the domestic lives and social rituals of the elite. In choosing color over black and white and producing large-format prints, she broke the tradition of established fine-art photography at the time. Her unstintingly honest portrayal of her subjects, many of whom are family and friends, remains completely original. <br> Straddling the line between candid and choreographed photography, between engagement and detachment, she captures her subjects in a range of rarefied settings, both private and public. Her iconic tableaux suggest rich narratives or, as she has written, the &#x201c;synchronization of psychological, emotional, and sociological plots that bind a family together.&#x201d; Long awaited, this lavish survey is the most definitive book to date on Barney&#x2019;s work.</p><p><b>Tina Barney</b>&nbsp;began her career in the mid-1970s when she started photographing in color with a large-format view camera. Her iconic images are in the permanent collections of numerous institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, among others.

Birds were trilling from the mature trees surrounding the expansive Van Alst property. A vase of French white lilacs scented the air, and from the windows we could see clusters of pink, white and red peonies beginning to bloom.<br><br>Walter the Pug was dancing around and wagging his little stump of a tail to show his appreciation for the day and the breakfast leftovers to come. Walter belongs to my friend Karen Smith, who married my uncle Lucky not that long ago. As their life appears to be one long mobile honeymoon, Walter now spends most of his time with me. That's a good thing.<br><br>But once I polished off my plate of sizzling golden French toast with whipped cream and mixed berries, plus a bracing serving of espresso, I had the nerve to ask for a week off. What was I thinking?<br><br>Vera Van Alst glanced up from the New York Times crossword. Her glance turned to a glower. Although the sun was beaming through the windows of the conservatory, I felt dark clouds gather.<br><br>Uncle Kev paused in the middle of raising his forkful of French toast and grinned. Vera's cook and housekeeper, Signora Panetone, gasped. I did my best not to grimace, even though exaggerated facial expressions seemed the order of the day.<br><br>Vera pushed back the fraying cuffs of her drab beige sweater. "Absolutely not, Miss Bingham. I do not pay you to take vacations. What do you think this is? A charitable institution?"<br><br>I opened my mouth to give a calm and reasoned summary of why I should be entitled to a week off. "Obviously you're not a charity," I said. "But as I have been working steadily for nearly two years and I-"<br><br>Those dark clouds began to drift across the bright June sky.<br><br>"We can't lose sight of the Hammett purchase. Time is of the essence." Vera turned back to her puzzle and raised her hand to cut off a rebuttal from my end.<br><br>This kind of discussion wasn't all that unusual for breakfast at Van Alst House. I'd grown accustomed to Vera's bad temper, ghastly wardrobe and unreasonable demands. I didn't let her get me down. She might be rich, living in a stately home with staff to look after her whims. She might indulge her passion of book collecting with a single-minded lack of concern for other people. She might always expect to get her own way. Still, I had it good. My job came with a charming and cozy attic apartment and the best food I'd ever had. I had a flexible schedule, a job I loved and a chance to make a bit of money on the side. Life was great. I'd even adjusted to having Uncle Kev, that charming time bomb, sitting across from me in the conservatory in the mornings and in the formal dining room in the night. Kev worked as our maintenance man, gardener and "other duties as required" guy. So far, no real disasters, if you don't count the exploding still, but I knew our peaceful days were numbered.<br><br>There was no way I could let Vera prevent me from taking my first vacation in I couldn't remember how long. Let's just say, I'd been beyond broke before I started here, and since my first day on the job, we had been remarkably busy. In case you don't know, my job was finding first editions of mysteries from the Golden Age of Detection and brokering deals that enhanced Vera's collection. Generally pleasant work although occasionally saving Vera's life seemed to fall under my duties. I could be spared for seven days. I wasn't an indentured serf, after all.<br><br>"Fine," I said, stiffening my spine and looking straight at Vera. "I'll take the time off without pay."<br><br>It wouldn't do my savings much good to lose a week's salary, but if Vera actually had the nerve to accept the offer, it would still be worth it. After all, Tyler Dekker had anted up for two airline tickets to San Francisco and a hotel, his way of making up for a few rocky patches in our relationship. We'd both had a bit too much murder in our lives and this trip was supposed to help us get back to normal. I had found myself dreaming about a relaxed pleasant vacation without a care in the world.<br><br>San Francisco was the old haunt of my uncle Seamus, now living as legend only, possibly in Rio or Tahiti. I'd heard stories about Seamus since I was a child. Although Seamus vanished from our lives before I was born, his sage advice continues on in our family as "the Kelly Rules." I would get to visit and see the spots where he'd pulled off some spectacular jobs. Perhaps I wouldn't make too much of it in front of my favorite police officer.<br><br>Vera was staring at her crossword puzzle as if the conversation had ended.<br><br>"You really shouldn't trust that Dekker guy enough to go away with him, Jordie," Uncle Kev said, before stuffing his mouth again. "What do you really know about him?"<br><br>What did I know about Tyler? I knew he was honest and stubborn and extremely neat. I knew we had rescued each other from disaster and near-death more than once. I knew he'd been willing to change jobs to keep our romance going. I knew we both loved dogs and chocolate. And apparently-although this was new information to me-he also had a thing for classic noir mysteries.<br><br>I hoped we could work past our misunderstandings and different values, because I also knew the spark was there.<br><br>"He is a cop, Kev, not a serial killer."<br><br>"Police officer. That says it all."<br><br>Kev's point could have been made by any of my uncles. I was the first person in my large, larcenous family to take the path of honest work. My relatives had put a bit of a strain on my relationship with Smiley, but we had worked past it, mostly. It was my side that couldn't trust a cop, even if he had left the job he loved and moved to the next police jurisdiction to avoid conflict of interest issues.<br><br>I said, "Don't worry."<br><br>Kev shrugged and reached for the maple syrup. "Be very careful is all I'm sayin', Jordie. That's the other side of the country and people get sucked out of planes all the time."<br><br>"For the record, Kev, people do not 'get sucked out of planes all the time,' and even if they did, which they do not, what would that have to do with Tyler Dekker?"<br><br>"Like I said, he's a cop."<br><br>There are some arguments that just go round and round. Most of Uncle Kev's, for instance.<br><br>Vera had upgraded her expression to a full-fledged scowl. She glanced up and met my eyes. "You are needed here, Miss Bingham. End of discussion."<br><br>I said, "Hold on a minute-"<br><br>Vera whirled in her wheelchair. "Take it or leave it, Miss Bingham. Decide if you want the job. Or not."<br><br>I felt like I'd been slapped. Of course I wanted the job. I needed the job. I loved the job. But a week off without pay? That wasn't asking much. What was wrong with her?<br><br>I was pretty sure Vera was bluffing. Should I call that bluff? This position was the most important part of my plan to get back to grad school. With built-in food and accommodations and that chance to sell a few books on my own, I was able to save almost everything I made.<br><br>Vera was spoiled and demanding; that must be obvious. She could have remembered that I had saved her life, her reputation and her books more than once. Maybe she thought she was being funny. She wasn't always clear on the finer points of humor.<br><br>I glanced at Kev and then back to Vera, but they were both gawking at the signora.<br><br>Signora Panetone is tiny, round and black-clad with an unlikely ebony bun that looks like it's been painted on her scalp. She will never see eighty again. At this moment she was hovering with a pale green platter and was just about to transfer a piece of French toast onto Vera's plate. Getting food to our boss usually takes planning as Vera never willingly eats anything. The signora jerked back the platter, pivoted and walked away. Vera, Kev and I regarded her broad, black-garbed body lumbering toward the kitchen.<br><br>Time ticked by as we sat there openmouthed. Such a thing had never happened in my time with Vera. The signora has worked at Van Alst House since Vera was a child. She is devoted. The door to the kitchen swung closed behind the wide black behind.<br><br>We may have still been staring two minutes later. The signora emerged with two little red spots glowing on her wrinkled cheeks. Her hands were on her hips.<br><br>"Ragazza viziata!" She turned and the door swung closed behind her again. I'd picked up a fair amount of Italian in my time at Van Alst House, but this was a new one. I thought it meant "spoiled brat."<br><br>A hush fell over the conservatory. I could hear Uncle Kev's breathing. I'm pretty sure he was worried about losing his four or possibly five square meals a day if I got fired. Maybe he'd have to go too, losing out on all the food and the endless supply of Jolly Ranchers that Vera kept in the house for him.<br><br>Still, I was thrilled by this unlikely ally. Unless I had misunderstood what had upset the signora, Vera had crossed a line. And, in fact, she had crossed a line. Not only was I a loyal employee, but I had also put my life on the line for Vera more than once and I deserved reasonable treatment. And I needed to seize the moment.<br><br>"So," I said, "back to my question. I'll take the week off with no pay, if you'd like, or I'll make up the time before or after the trip and take the pay. What will it be?"<br><br>But Vera was watching the door. Could she have been nervous? Not possible. No history of that whatsoever.<br><br>"The Hammett item takes precedence over everything, Miss Bingham." Obviously, she was prepared to stick to her guns although I thought I heard a wobble in that gravelly voice. But I was also sticking to my guns. Smiley had bought nonrefundable tickets, which might not have been the most practical plan as he'd done it before I'd agreed. It was a big deal for him. San Francisco might have been a romantic city, but Smiley was such a fan of Sam Spade and the Continental Op that-oh, what was the matter with me?<br><br>"Exactly," I said, smiling triumphantly.<br><br>"What are you jabbering about, Miss Bingham?" Vera said. She'd lost a bit of her fire when the signora stormed out.<br><br>From the kitchen came a one-sided conversation in Italian.<br><br>"Cattiva! Schifosa! Bruta!" What? Ugly? Wicked? Bad? Wow.<br><br>The kitchen door swung open and the signora emerged, empty handed, arms crossing her round body. She gave Vera what is known around here as malocchio, the evil eye. I'd just never expected to see that directed at Vera. It suddenly occurred to me that Vera had learned her scowling from this unexpected teacher.<br><br>They glared each other down. The musical score from High Noon hummed in my brain. Walter whimpered and pushed up against my leg. Good Cat and Bad Cat, the unpredictable and ever-present Siamese, were nowhere to be seen.<br><br>"You let la povera raggaza go to vacation, Vera."<br><br>Generally, I wouldn't like to be thought of as the "poor girl," but these were desperate times.<br><br>Uncle Kev's baby blues almost popped out. I'm sure my own eyes were hovering in midair, like a frame out of Roger Rabbit.<br><br>Vera opened her mouth slowly and ominously.<br><br>This was not a light moment.<br><br>I said in what I hoped was an up-tempo voice, "San Francisco was Hammett's town, Vera. He's a legend there, part of the culture. Surely that's where we'll find a signed first edition of Red Harvest, right there in Hammett's old neighborhood. And with the shipping on someone else's dime. It's settled."<br><br>The signora viewed with me suspicion. Probably there was little she'd have understood in that sentence.<br><br>Vera nodded slowly. You'd almost think she was grateful for my Hail Mary pass.<br><br>The signora spoke. "Jordan needs vacation. She saved your life, Vera. You pay Jordan, Vera. Don't take 'vantage."<br><br>Vera sputtered. Keeping face had always been important to the Van Alst family, and now there was only Vera to uphold the tradition. "Fine. Suit yourself, Fiammetta."<br><br>The signora's black eyes shone victoriously. Her cheeks were flushed with triumph. She smoothed her vast floral apron like a general dusting off his epaulettes. I hoped I wasn't dreaming.<br><br>"Don't let things get behind. I won't tolerate that. Twelve hundred, tops. Negotiate. I'll give you cash," Vera muttered in my general direction. That sounded like the real Vera. I took her words to mean my vacation to San Francisco was a go and I would pay the price for it on my return.<br><br>"That's good then. I should go make arrangements."<br><br>"You know I can't stand chirping, Miss Bingham."<br><br>"I couldn't agree more," I chirped.<br><br>The signora emerged again with the French toast, and Uncle Kev reached happily forward with his plate. The signora beamed at him like he had just cured world hunger. Vera turned back to her crossword.<br><br>Peace and harmony fell upon our land. Except I had not the slightest idea how I was going to get that signed first edition of Red Harvest. But you only live once. And I'd cross that golden gate when I came to it. I was going to San Francisco.<br><br>Only one more mountain to climb before it was time to pack.<br><br>CHAPTER TWO<br><br>Don't trust anyone except maybe family.<br><br>-The Kelly Rules<br><br>Vera was not the only obstacle to a blissful vacation and not even the main one. You can quit your job, but it would be hard to quit your family. There was still Uncle Mick to contend with. Fortunately Uncle Lucky was still in New York City with Karen. At least I wasn't outnumbered.<br><br>"But to think what he does for a living!" Uncle Mick moaned as he put the finishing touches (mustard) on fried baloney sandwiches, a specialty of the Kelly kitchen. He wiped his hands on his Kiss the Blarney Stone apron with the downward-pointing arrow. His ginger hair seemed to grow redder and his ginger eyebrows wilder.</p><h2>The Besieged City</h2><p><p><strong>Seven decades after its original publication, Clarice Lispector&#x2019;s third novel&#x2015;the story of a girl and the city her gaze reveals&#x2015;is in English at last</strong></p><p>Seven decades after its original publication, Clarice Lispector&#x2019;s third novel&#x2015;the story of a girl and the city her gaze reveals&#x2015;is in English at last.

Brazier, a wealthy industrialist and potent political force (� la Ross Perot), is conducting questionable business with the Russian government (� la George Soros's evil twin), and nothing will stop him in his quest to snap up formerly state-owned industries at bargain prices--certainly not a trivial consideration such as trade legislation pending in the House Foreign Relations Committee.<p> When Mac Smith is asked to bring his legal expertise to a research mission in Moscow, he finds himself attempting to clear Latham's name--and getting closer and closer to some <i>very</i> dangerous individuals.</p><p> Margaret Truman is operating according to established parameters in <i>Murder in the House</i>, but fans will appreciate the relative skill with which she weaves together the themes of disturbing relationships on two continents: hard-line Communists with the Russian mafia on one hand, and politics with American big business on the other.</p><p> Readers may want to check out other entries in the Capital Crimes series--try <i>Murder on Embassy Row</i>, <i>Murder at the National Gallery</i>, or <i>Murder in the CIA</i>. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>The never-ending fascination with our nation's capital has made Margaret Truman's novels bestsellers everywhere, including in my territory in Southern California.

But, perhaps because he had seen how fortunes may disappear overnight, never to be recovered, Bulfinch puts his faith in the kind of knowledge that can make us &#x201c;happier and better.&#x201d; This knowledge is the knowledge of literature, but we cannot understand the literature of our time without first understanding the mythology that literature so often alludes to. </p><p>How is this knowledge to be attained? Bulfinch is very certain about his audience. It does not consist of members of his own class, the privileged few who have had the benefits of a classical education and would have acquired such knowledge already or at least have the leisure and the means to acquire it. His audience has never gone with Homer to Troy; the Trojan War is new to them; and they want to know how the story comes out in the end: &#x201c;Our readers will be anxious to know the fate of Helen, the fair but guilty occasion of so much slaughter.&#x201d; As Bulfinch must have known, Helen is the creation of the poets who wrote about her, and different poets provided her with different fates. Americans love happy endings, so Bulfinch sees her reconciled at last with the husband she abandoned. </p><p>Bulfinch&#x2019;s audience consists of those with whom he had come in contact during his long and unsuccessful career as a merchant, the self-made men and their wives, who do not want to have to choke down &#x201c;only the dry facts without any of the charm of the original narrative.&#x201d; They want the poetry, too, and they don&#x2019;t have a whole lot of time to spend on getting it. </p><p>They want to be sure that this knowledge may be let into the parlors of their homes without creating any sort of offense &#x201c;to pure taste and good morals.&#x201d; Here a word must be said about Bulfinch&#x2019;s prudery: His subservience to his society&#x2019;s desire to pass over these offenses in silence resulted in a number of significant omissions. It is hard to see how it could be otherwise: The proper Bostonian of Bulfinch&#x2019;s day, referring to a bull as Mr. Cow, would scarcely have known what to make of Queen Phaedra&#x2019;s passion for the prize bull in her husband&#x2019;s herd. </p><p>Bulfinch&#x2019;s readers also want the assurance that this knowledge, so different from their daily experience, is worth having: &#x201c;To devote study to a species of learning which relates wholly to false marvels and obsolete faiths is not to be expected of the general reader in a practical age like this. The time even of the young is claimed by so many sciences of facts and things that little can be set for spare treatises on a science of mere fancy.&#x201d; It is not only the time but the energy as well. Bulfinch can sympathize with the tired businessman at the end of his long day in the office: &#x201c;Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study, but as a relaxation from study.&#x201d;</p><p>This knowledge, easily acquired and promoting not only happiness but virtue as well, will allow the less privileged members of a restlessly mobile society access to the kind of lore that is the patrimony of the privileged. It is not, Bulfinch states explicitly, &#x201c;for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation.&#x201d; It is a little bit easier than it ought to be to mock Bulfinch&#x2019;s tone here, but we would be seriously underestimating Bulfinch if we were to regard him as an elitist: His sentiments are as unabashed in their democratic impulse as those of Walt Whitman, in his preface to Leaves of Grass. Bulfinch wishes everyone to have access to the cultural tokens heretofore the possession of the few.</p></p><h2>Look Up My Soul: The Divine Promise of Hope</h2><p>In this book, Gerald N. Lund talks about hope a fundamental but often overlooked virtue. He talks about the realities of life in our day, the reasons many of us lack hope, and the need for hope in our time. He shares insights on such questions as: What is hope? How does hope relate to faith and charity? How do we gain, strengthen, and maintain hope, especially in times of despair? What role does the Savior play in our efforts to develop hope? What are the divine promises in which we can trust to foster hope? Elder Lund also includes many stories from Church history, from his own life, and from the lives of acquaintances to illustrate his insights. He helps us recognize that hope is more than an attitude of good cheer and more than a generalized faith in God. It is an abiding trust that God fulfills His divine promises to us.</p><p>Gerald N. Lund served as a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy from 2002 to 2008. He worked for the Church Educational System for thirty-five years as a teacher, writer, and zone administrator. He is a prolific writer of both fiction and doctrinal works. He and his wife, Lynn, are the parents of seven children and live in Alpine, Utah.</p><h2>After Liberalism</h2><p><p>In<em> After Liberalism</em>, the distinguished historian and political scientist Immanuel Wallerstein examines the process of disintegration of our modern world-system and speculates on the changes that may occur during the next few decades. He explores the historical choices before us and suggests paths for reconstructing our world-system on a more rational and socially equitable basis.</p><br></p><p>The intellectual left has been largely adrift since the fall of communism. Some illusions having collapsed with the Berlin Wall, many liberals have sought vainly for some substantial support for their instinctive beliefs. Wallerstein, a distinguished historian and sociologist who teaches in Paris and New York and a champion of the left in the Marxist tradition, seeks to provide some of that intellectual buttressing. He calls for the rejection by the left of liberalism, which he sees as a failed centrist tactic. Rational reform on the basis of liberal assumptions of continued economic growth is no longer sustainable, he argues. This collection of his articles between 1991 and 1995 details his ideas for a radically decentralized and democratized approach to replace liberalism.Immanuel Wallerstein is a senior research scholar in the department of sociology at Yale University and director emeritus of the Fernand Braudel Center at Binghamton University. He is also a resident researcher at the Maison des Sciences de l&#x2019;Homme in Paris. His many books include <em>The Modern World-System</em> and <em>Historical Capitalism</em>. The New Press has published <em>After Liberalism</em>, <em>The Decline of American Power</em>, and a collection of his works, <em>The Essential Wallerstein</em>.

There are murderers, a &#x201c;stout and moon-faced&#x201d; bigamist named Jiggs Perry, and a bingo-addicted tenant with a grudge who bludgeoned her landlady; and tragedies like the 1883 fire at Newhall House...This history is teeming with interesting characters like Rosina Georg, a proprietor of a dance hall known for underage drinking and an interracial clientele, and Frank Blunt, a thieving womanizer who was raised as a girl but lived as a man. Other tales include a suicide by cannon, an antikissing crusade, roving bands of flirtatious fops, and the chilling account of a young woman picked up for a blind date and never seen alive again. Prigge plucks these stories from obscurity and vividly brings them to life. He also helpfully identifies the modern locations of settings should readers feel inclined to take a macabre Milwaukee tour. <b>(Publisher's Weekly, September 2015)</b><br><br> A simply fascinating and fully absorbing read from begininning to end, <i>Milwaukee Mayhem: Murder and Mystery in the Cream City's First Century</i> is...exceptionally well researched, impressively well written, and deftly crafted with the inclusion of occasional&nbsp; black-and- white historical photos. <i>Milwaukee Mayhem</i> is highly recommended&nbsp; for both community and academic library American History refernce collections in general, and Wisconsin History supplemental&nbsp; studies lists in particular. <b>(John Burroughs, Burroughs' Bookshelf, Midwest Book Review, Reviewer's Bookwatch, December 2015)</b></p><h2>The Third Horseman: A Story of Weather, War, and the Famine History Forgot</h2><p><b>The incredible true story of how a cycle of rain, cold, disease, and warfare created the worst famine in European history&#x2014;years before the Black Death, from the author of <i>Justinian's Flea </i>and the forthcoming <i>Miracle Cure</i></b><br><br>In May 1315, it started to rain.

This fascinating and evocative volume looks at a world in which humans are neither the measure nor the master, but an encumbered intruder. From the waters of the Galapagos to the Red Sea, from the Pacific shores to the fresh waters of North America, Water Light Time includes over 25 years of Doubilet&#39;s work, and reveals the mesmerising beauty of more than 30 bodies of water. Rich with fascinating sea creatures, wondrous life forms and breathtaking underwater landscapes, Water Light Time is an unforgettable look at many of the earth&#39;s most remarkable natural compositions.</p><p>When David Doubilet was a child, he photographed swimmers in the waters off of New Jersey. <i>Water Light Time</i> is a collection of images that capture the underwater magnificence that seized the photographer's imagination in childhood and spurred a lifelong fascination. Underwater plant life floating like snakes, bright blue water filled with schools of silver fish, a diver immersed in a throng of bubbling yellow jellyfish, a close-up of pink and white sea anemones looking all the world like a floating bouquet of flowers--each image in this book is exquisitely photographed with preternaturally clear colors, full of detail and depth. Some images toy with perspective, creating surreal tableaux as a crustacean leg pokes out of the yellow-green water to appear almost as large as a nearby tree.<p> With a career that started as a <i>National Geographic</i> photographer in 1972, Doubilet has a lifetime of experience from which to make such a marvelous meditation on this otherworld that is vaguely familiar to most readers only through pictures and visits to aquariums. Doubilet captures what must surely be his own awe at the uniqueness of being a human in this nonhuman environment, and the reader can marvel at both the lushness of life in the water and at the beauty of the photographs themselves, which dominate almost all of the book's 240 pages. <i>--Jennifer Cohen</i></p>Beneath the world&#39;s waters lie landscapes, species, vegetations and populations as diverse as those on land, yet these kingdoms have been explored by few. This book looks at the work of David Doubilet, artist, diver, and underwater photographer.

The production of pottery is one of the oldest Mexican crafts. There is not a state in Mexico that does not produce some sort of ceramic ware, whether it be for purposes decorative, functional, religious, or playful. This book displays Mexican ceramics of the twentieth century. It is organized by geographic area, focusing on the eight states with the most important potteries. Within these states, the pieces are further divided by village or town, style, family, and individual artisan. Based upon an exhibition of over 1,200 pieces at the California Heritage Museum in Santa Monica, California, each color picture is accompanied by a detailed description of the pieces, including, when possible, the artist, style, place of origin, date of production, and size of the piece. This book will be a useful resource for the collector, the traveler, the artist, and everyone who wants to explore a wonderful aspect of Mexican culture.</p><p>Amanda Thompson supervises all inbound and outbound immigration for the Fermi Research Alliance LLC, which administers and operates the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory for the Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, in Batavia, Illinois.

From its earliest days, Kansas City was in the business of provisioning pioneers and traders headed west, and later with provisioning the nation with meat and wheat. Throughout its history, thousands of Kansas Citians have also made their living providing meals and hospitality to travelers passing through on their way elsewhere, be it by way of a steamboat, Conestoga wagon, train, automobile, or airplane. As Kansas City&#x2019;s adopted son, Fred Harvey sagely noted, &#x201c;Travel follows good food routes,&#x201d; and Kansas City&#x2019;s identity as a food city is largely based on that fact. Kansas City: A Food Biography explores in fascinating detail how a frontier town on the edge of wilderness grew into a major metropolis, one famous for not only great cuisine but for a crossroads hospitality that continues to define it. Kansas City: A Food Biography also explores how politics, race, culture, gender, immigration, and art have forged the city&#x2019;s most iconic dishes, from chili and steak to fried chicken and barbecue. In lively detail, Andrea Broomfield brings the Kansas City food scene to life.</p><p>Andrea Broomfield is a culinary historian and an English professor at Johnson County Community College. She is the author of Food and Cooking in Victorian England: A History (2007) and writes extensively about the Victorian era.Kansas City, Mo., home to Charlie Parker and the strains of modern jazz, also rests at the culinary crossroads of America, as culinary historian Broomfield observes in this straightforward survey, part of the Big City Food Biography series. The city is located in the fertile Central Plain, where the soil is ideal for cultivating grain and producing fields of grass where cattle can graze. Broomfield&#x2019;s tale of the life of food in the region begins with the earliest contributions of native tribes such as the Kaw, and their cultivation of maize and squash. Prior to the Civil War, Kansas City&#x2019;s food reflected the cuisine of the South, including beaten biscuits, pies, gumbos, fried chicken, and catfish. In the 19th century, a number of immigrant groups helped shape the city&#x2019;s cuisine with Mexican tamales and chilis, German beer, Swiss confections, and Italian minestrone and pastas. Broomfield offers a brief history of many of the markets and groceries that helped establish Kansas City as a center of culinary hospitality, such as the E. Whyte Grocery, Fruit &amp; Wine Company; Wolferman&#x2019;s Grocery; and the City Market. Broomfield&#x2019;s guidebook also includes an overview of Kansas City&#x2019;s signature dishes (with recipes), such as Myron Green&#x2019;s cinnamon rolls and Harvey&#x2019;s Westport Room Chicken Maciel. Readers will enjoy this entertaining, in-depth look at the foods that have made Kansas City famous. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>The latest in the Big City Food Biography series examines the culinary contributions made by the center of the heartland&#x2019;s bread basket, Kansas City. Broomfield&#x2019;s research is meticulous and balanced. She notes that Kansas City straddles a state line historically and culturally and pays equal attention to both sides. This is not a book for the casual cook looking for gastronomic descriptions and recipes. Her prose is engaging and lively, even though not an ingredient, restaurant, cook, or restaurateur detail goes unmentioned. Serious chefs and foodies will appreciate the history behind the Midwest&#x2019;s melting pot of cuisines and the people who made Kansas City&#x2019;s signature dishes burnt ends, KC strip, and green rice casserole&#x2014;the mainstays of hearty Kansas City fare. Of particular interest is the chapter on 'African American Contributions and Kansas City&#x2019;s Southern Traditions.' Readers will be fascinated by the ways music influenced restaurants in Kansas City&#x2019;s jazz age. A worthy addition to all collections serving the serious chef.

With welcome detail, Broomfield explains native cultures' expansion of hunting, cooking and farming across centuries, as well as taste trends.... Kansas City is hardly unique in boasting a rich and proud culinary heritage.

It should be noted that Kansas City: A Food Biography is no light coverage: anticipate a college-level reader that includes discussions of Kansas City's evolving culture, politics, social atmosphere, and immigrant influences: all of which contributed to the region's culinary heritage. (<i>Donovan's Bookshelf</i>)<br><br>Kansas City: A Food Biography is perhaps the best brief survey of Kansas City foodways and history&#x2014;the two completely intertwined&#x2014;in print....

In the process we learn important lessons about what food has meant to the generations of diverse peoples who have made it their home.

(Jonathan Deutsch, PhD, Professor of Culinary Arts and Food Science)<br><br>Food culture in the U.S. has been co-opted by quick service and processed foods; Broomfield's book is an important contribution to our attempts to discover what Kansas City tastes like. She does an excellent job of researching not only the native foods of the city but also the ones that arrived here "in the pockets" of the immigrants who built this city. She also thoroughly documents how the peoples of Kansas City used those foods to build a strong culture of food-tied-to-place in our town.

Ever since, she has wondered why the Lord spared her, what he has in store for her. But her pagan father thinks she was spared solely so she could be introduced to the wealthy wonder-worker, Nikolaos. </p><p> Nikolaos has never questioned that his call in life is to dedicate himself to the church and to God. Never, that is, until he and his cousin Petros meet the compelling Cyprus Visibullis. For years he struggles with the feelings she inspires...and with the sure knowledge that Petros loves her too. </p><p> Petros knows he will never be good enough for Cyprus's father to consider him as a match for his favorite daughter not as long as Nikolaos is there. But when tragedy strikes the Visibullis family, he will do anything to save his beloved. Unfortunately, his beloved is determined to do anything to save her sisters ~ even at the cost of herself. </p><p> As the festival of lights bathes their Greek city in beauty, Cyprus, Petros, and Nikolaos celebrate the miracle of their Savior s birth together one last time. And in remembrance of their Lord's greatest gift, one of them will make the ultimate sacrifice for the others...and a centuries-long tradition will be born.</p></p><p>Perfect for the Christmas season, White's latest is a storythat begs to become a tradition.

Ravishingly designed and illustrated by the acclaimed Israeli artist and calligrapher Oded Ezer, <i>New American Haggadah</i> is an utterly unique and absorbing prayer book, the first of its kind, that brings together some of the preeminent voices of our time.</p><p>Jonathan Safran Foer is one of the most acclaimed young writers of his generation. His books have received numerous awards including a National Jewish Book Award and a Guardian First Book Award, and have been translated into thirty-six languages. He garnered remarkable praise for his first two novels, <i>Everything Is Illuminated</i> (adapted for film in 2005) and <i>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</i> (adapted for film in December 2011), and for his <i>New York Times</i> bestselling work of nonfiction, <i>Eating Animals</i>. <br><br>Nathan Englander is the author of the novel, <i>The Ministry of Special Cases</i>, the play, <i>The Twenty-Seventh Man</i>, and the story collections <i>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges</i> and <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank</i>, which won the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award and was a Pulitzer Prize Finalist. He lives in Brooklyn, New York with his wife Rachel Silver. <br>"A touching and scholarly Haggadah that offers fresh insights....what makes this Haggadah shine is the combination of commentary, design, and illustration....[it makes] us think, laugh, cry, and ask questions." <br>&#x2015;<b>Julia Neuberger</b>, <b><i><em>Financial Times<br></em></i></b><br><br>"This Haggadah sings to more than one generation; it is glorious and rich, funny and affirming.

To this end he joins a small geological expedition, which travels to the far North of Norway, where he hopes to prove a series of craters were caused by meteorites, but ultimately realizes he&#39;s more likely to drown in a fjord or be eaten by parasites. Unable to procure crucial aerial photographs, and beset by mosquitoes and insomnia in his freezing leaky tent, Alfred becomes increasingly desperate and paranoid. Haunted by the ghost of his scientist father, unable to escape the looming influence of his mother, and anxious to complete the thesis that will make his name, he moves toward the final act of vanity which will trigger a catastrophe. A deadpan comedy often subtly calling up the works of Heller or Vonnegut at their best, Beyond Sleep is a unique and illuminating examination of how hard it is to be a true pioneer in the modern world.

Jimmy Donovan, befriended a stray dog that he named Rags. No longer an unwanted street mutt, Rags became the&nbsp;mascot to the entire First Division of the American Expeditionary Force and a friend to the American troops who had crossed the Atlantic to fight. Rags was more than a scruffy face and a wagging tail, however. The little terrier mix was with the division at the crucial battle of Soissons, at the Saint-Mihiel offensive, and finally in the blood-and-mud bath of the Meuse-Argonne, during which he and his guardian were wounded. Despite being surrounded by distraction and danger, Rags learned to carry messages through gunfire, locate broken communications wire for the Signal Corps to repair, and alert soldiers to incoming shells, saving the lives of hundreds of American soldiers. Through it all, he brought inspiration to men with little to hope for, especially in the bitter last days of the war.<p><i>From Stray Dog to World War I Hero</i> covers Rags&#x2019;s entire life story, from the bomb-filled years of war through his secret journey to the United States that began his second life, one just as filled with drama and heartache.

Jerusalem and his cohorts step up their investigation into Callahan&#x2019;s misdeeds and turn up some startling evidence...not to mention a sole surviving witness to the President&#x2019;s depravity. The problem, as always, will be getting the word out before the massive forces of the Executive Branch black out everything &#x2014; and everyone &#x2014; involved.</p></p><p>Warren Ellis is one of the most prolific, read, and admired graphic novelists in the world and the creator of &#34;Transmetropolitan&#34; and &#34;The Authority&#34;. He lives in southern England with his partner, Niki, and their daughter, Lilith. He never sleeps.This collection of the popular Transmetropolitan series follows the adventures of famous renegade journalist Spider Jerusalem. He spends his time in the future dystopia The City avoiding hit men and dealing with government corruption, media infiltration and conspiracy paranoia. In this installment, Jerusalem and his assistants are racing against government assassins to find the last living transient sex worker who serviced America's president and expose the government's web of crime and corruption. Against the post-apocalyptic urban landscape of a federal disaster zone, Jerusalem, who's a cross between Hunter S. Thompson and Bladerunner, is also fighting early onset dementia from a brain infection. Writer Ellis pulls out all the stops to offend, including Nazi sex midgets, and the main character crosses every possible journalistic ethic to get his story. A dark palette and heavy use of black suits the bleak, violent story line; thematic details bind the story together, such as the curlicues of smoke that follow Jerusalem's chain-smoking editor from panel to panel. The artwork helps shore up the weak plot, especially in later pages, with almost hidden background textual details. Labels and message T-shirts provide humor (e.g., one woman's shirt reads "sex object"; a taxi door implores "don't shoot"), along with self-referential graffiti, hotel signs and documents that refer to filmmakers past and present. While this collection doesn't live up to the series' earlier anthologies, the smug lead character and tongue-in-cheek details (reminiscent of MAD Magazine) will please longtime fans. The collection also includes original series covers by Moebius and Glenn Fabry. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their 800-year rule ended a century ago - and yet, travelling through twelve countries from Kosovo to Greece to Palestine, she uncovers a legacy that's vital and relevant; where medieval ethnic diversity meets 21st century nationalism, and displaced people seek new identities.</p><p>It's a story of surprises. An acolyte of Erdogan in Christian-majority Serbia confirms the wide-reaching appeal of his authoritarian leadership. A Druze warlord explains the secretive religious faction in the heart of the Middle East. The palimpsest-like streets of Jerusalem's Old Town hint at the Ottoman co-existence of Muslims and Jews. And in Turkish Cyprus Alev Scott rediscovers a childhood home. In every community, history is present as a dynamic force.</p><p>Faced by questions of exile, diaspora and collective memory, Alev Scott searches for answers from the cafes of Beirut to the refugee camps of Lesbos. She uncovers in Erdogan's nouveau-Ottoman Turkey a version of the nostalgic utopias sold to disillusioned voters in Europe and the U.S. And yet - as she relates with compassion, insight and humour - diversity is the enduring, endangered heart of this fascinating region.</p></p><p></p><h2>In the Vanguard: Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, 1950-1969</h2><p><i>In the Vanguard: Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, 1950&#x2013;1969</i> traces this unique school&#x2019;s impact on American art during the mid-twentieth century.

Churchill's literary masterpiece. Published across five volumes between 1923 and 1931, Churchill here tells the story of The Great War, from its origins to the long shadow it cast on the following decades. At once a history and a first-hand account of Churchill's own involvement in the war, <i>The World Crisis </i>remains a compelling account of the conflict and its importance.</p><p>In the fifth and final volume of <i>The World Crisis</i>, Winston Churchill turns his attention to the 'forgotten war' on the Eastern Front. His focus is the great rivalry between Russia and the Austro-German alliance during the years of the First World War, from the tensions over Bosnia and Serbia that triggered the conflict through the terrible battles on the Eastern Front to the final collapse of the Russian forces that triggered the Revolution.</p></p><p>In the final volume of his history of World War One, Churchill chronicles the war on the Eastern Front between Russian and the Austro-German alliance.Sir Winston S. Churchill (1874-1965) was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on two occasions, from 1940-1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Celebrated as one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth century, he was also a gifted orator, statesman and historian.

The story of Hitler's transformation is one of a fateful match between man and city. After opportunistically fluctuating between the ideas of the left and the right, Hitler emerged as an astonishingly flexible leader of Munich's right-wing movement. The tragedy for Germany and the world was that Hitler found himself in Munich; had he not been in Bavaria in the wake of the war and the revolution, his transformation into a National Socialist may never have occurred. <br><br>In <i>Becoming Hitler</i>, Weber brilliantly charts this tragic metamorphosis, dramatically expanding our knowledge of how Hitler became a lethal demagogue.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Thomas Weber</b> is a professor of history and international affairs at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland.

Professor Ralph Raico shows them to be wolves in sheep's clothing and their wars as attacks on human liberty and human rights.In the backdrop of this blistering and deeply insightful and scholarly history is the whitewashing of "great leaders" like Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill, FDR, Truman, Stalin, Trotsky, and other collectivists. They are highly regarded because they were on the "right side" of the rise of the state. But do they deserve adulation? Raico says no: these great leaders were main agents in the decline of civilization in the 20th century, all of them anti-liberals who used their power to celebrate and enhance state power.Robert Higgs writes the introduction and cheers this powerful expose as a necessary corrective."For Ralph Raico," writes Robert Higgs in the foreword, "it would be not only unseemly but foolish to quiver obsequiously in the historical presence of a Churchill, a Roosevelt, or a Truman. He knows when he has encountered a politician who lusted after power and public adulation, and he describes the man accordingly. He does not sweep under the rug the crimes committed by the most publicly revered Western political leaders. If they ordered or acceded to the commission of mass murder, he tells us, without mincing words, that they did so. The idea that the United States has invariably played the role of savior or 'good guy' in its international relations Raico recognizes as state propaganda, rather than honest history."Thus, in these pages, you will find descriptions and accounts of World War I, of the lead-up to formal U.S. belligerence in World War II, and of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Truman, among others, that bear little resemblance to what you were taught in school. Here you will encounter, perhaps for the first time, compelling evidence of how the British maneuvered U.S. leaders and tricked the American people prior to the U.S. declarations of war in 1917 and 1941. You will read about how the British undertook to starve the Germans &#x2013; men, women, and children alike &#x2013; not only during World War I, but for the greater part of a year after the armistice. You will be presented with descriptions of how the communists were deified and the German people demonized by historians and others who ought to have known better. You will see painted in truer shades a portrait of the epic confrontation between the great majority of Americans who wished to keep their country at peace in 1939, 1940, and 1941 and the well-placed, unscrupulous minority who sought to plunge the United States into the European maelstrom."Raico&#x2019;s historical essays are not for the faint of heart or for those whose loyalty to the U.S. or British state outweighs their devotion to truth and humanity. Yet Ralph did not invent the ugly facts he recounts here, as his ample documentation attests. Indeed, many historians have known these facts, but few have been willing to step forward and defy politically popular and professionally fashionable views in the forthright, pull-no-punches way that Raico does. The historians&#x2019; principal defect for the most part has not been a failure or refusal to dig out the relevant facts, but rather a tendency to go along to get along in academia and 'respectable' society, a sphere in which individual honesty and courage generally count against a writer or teacher, whereas capitulation to trendy nonsense often brings great rewards and professional acclaim."Table of ContentsForeword by Robert HiggsIntroductionI EssaysWorld War I: The Turning PointRethinking ChurchillHarry S.

Deena Metzger has written a novel in which two people, who are from each side of this polarity, begin a loving relationship. Sandra Birdswell is a student of climatology with an uncanny ability to sense weather events. Her mother, who died in childbirth, is a mystery to her. Her father, John, formerly a Reservation doctor, faithfully raises her despite his limitations and obligations. She first meets Terrence, a Native man and a professor of climatology, at her university classes. Years later, they are drawn together by the powerful forces of their love, for the Earth, for each other, and their mutual need to seek out the broken links of their family histories. When the UN report on climate change is released in 2007, the reality of the effects of the Anthropocene era sends a shockwave through both their lives. Their relationship to each other and to the elementals they are so intimate with lightning, thunder, rain, mountain brings them deeply and violently into a quest to live their lives in ways that disengage from colonial mind, the same mind that brought devastation to the Native peoples, and now brings all of humanity to the brink of extinction. Through their love of and deeply felt intuitive connection to the Earth, they each go to the brink of death to find their truth, to gain strength and wisdom.</p><p>Deena Metzger is a writer and healer living at the end of the road in Topanga, California. Deena is a radical thinker on behalf of the natural world and planetary survival, a teacher of writing and healing practices for 50 years and a writer and activist profoundly concerned with peacemaking, restoration and sanctuary for a beleaguered world. She has been convening ReVisioning Medicine bringing Indigenous medicine ways to heal the medical world since 2004, and is imagining a Literature of Restoration as foundations of a new viable culture. She, with writer Michael Ortiz Hill, introduced Dare to North America in 1999. Dare and the 19 Ways Training for the 5th World, are unique forms of individual, community and environmental healing based on Indigenous and contemporary medicine and wisdom traditions.In clear and elegant prose, Deena Metzger yet again explores the most important issues of our time, in yet another profound and compelling way. A Rain of Night Birds is a beautiful and important novel. --Derrick Jensen, author of A Language Older Than Words<br><br>Now more than ever, we need to read, and then read again, Deena Metzger s new novel, a thrilling exploration of the dilemmas we face as a species beset with extinction and as individuals beset by doubts as to how that threat to our loved ones and the Earth can be avoided in our age of confusion. The four complex protagonists take us on a journey into the depths of their despair and the lightening of their hopes, and by its end we are left trembling with grief and wisdom, challenged to leap into the arduous self-under- standing of ourselves and the indigenous past that alone can guide us through the turmoil and the fire and, perhaps, who knows, save the Earth. --Ariel Dorfman, author of the play Death and the Maiden and the forthcoming novel Darwin s Ghosts<br><br>This book blew me away! I loved the characters, the writing, the unfolding of it. As a longtime environmentalist with strong Indigenous and racial justice leanings, I found it riveting, compelling and resonant. The story and characters drew me in deeply, in ways that reached my intuition, my dream time and my empathic, embodied sense of self. I immersed myself in it, reading it in several sittings as I was so engrossed. It s rare that a writer can convey so much that spans from the deeply personal to the transpersonal or universal levels, but Deena does it, masterfully. I highly recommend this book for any- one who loves Mother Earth, who resonates with Indigenous Wisdom, and who wishes to fulfill their own greatest destiny at this transformative moment for all life on Earth. --Nina Simons, Co-Founder, Bioneers; Co-Founder, Cultivating Women's Leadership</p><h2>Frost Like Night (Snow Like Ashes, 3)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Game of Thrones</em></strong><strong> meets <em>Graceling</em> in this action-packed fantasy&#x2014;the highly anticipated final book in the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Snow Like Ashes series by Sara Raasch.

She fell under the spell of the north in the late 1920s after a sailing excursion to the Arctic Ocean. Over the next three decades, she achieved international notoriety as a rugged and audacious polar explorer while maintaining her flamboyant lifestyle as a leading society woman. Yet despite organizing, financing, and directing seven daring Arctic expeditions between 1926 and 1955, she is virtually unknown today.</p><p>Joanna Kafarowski, Ph.D., is an independent scholar and a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, an Affiliate Member of the American Geographical Society, and a Member of the Society of Woman Geographers. She is an inveterate traveller and currently divides her time between Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, and Marple, Cheshire, England.She gripped the ship&#x2019;s railing tightly with both rough-gloved hands while gazing sombrely into the sprawling darkness of the frozen night. Tall for a woman, broad-shouldered, wavy brown hair tucked under a snug cap framing a handsome face with piercing blue eyes, she could easily have been mistaken for one of the crew. Beneath her feet, the Hobby juddered and jarred as it made its way through the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean. The air was a constant thrum of men&#x2019;s guttural voices, the clang of thick cables and ropes, the bursting swell of the ocean as the ship slammed through the seething waves, moving forward on its perilous mission. Though unaccustomed to life onboard ship, and only recently acquainted with northern waters, California native Louise Arner Boyd found herself profoundly moved and invigorated by the experience &#x2015; and more than a little unsettled. Whether above or below deck, she was never alone. There were always experienced seamen keeping a watchful eye on the gently bred American socialite who had somehow become an integral part of one of the most desperate quests in polar history &#x2015; the 1928 search for missing famed Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen.<br> She caught herself as the ship yawed abruptly to starboard. What was she thinking? Only a few weeks before, she had been dressed in a bejewelled gown, dining on lobster at Claridge&#x2019;s in London, England, and dancing the quickstep at the Ritz. And yet here she was, wearing stiff leather boots and rough woollen trousers that itched like the dickens, standing unsteadily on the slippery bow of a ship sailing northward. There was so much for her to absorb &#x2015; so much that the male crew members just took for granted. Louise spent hours poring over detailed nautical charts, checking the Hobby&#x2019;s position with a sextant, and quizzing the officers; more than might be expected of a respectable society lady of a certain age. But, if she was going to contribute and really make a difference to this expedition, then she had to learn, and quickly, too. As Hobby&#x2019;s hull rose and fell rhythmically, she mused to herself that this was not the trip to Greenland that she had originally intended. Who knew what winding, dreary path her life would have taken if the Amundsen tragedy had not intervened and disrupted her travel plans? As unlikely as it seemed, Miss Louise Arner Boyd of San Rafael, California, was never supposed to be discussing weighty matters with naval commanders on the high seas, recognized by all onboard as one of the leaders of a daring rescue mission of international significance.<br> During that summer of 1928, far above the frigid Arctic Circle, the weathered schooner Hobby, Louise, and the Norwegian crew, including Captain Kristian Johannesen and Captain&#x2019;s Mate Astrup Holm, were sailing north in search of one of the greatest explorers of all time. Renowned for his bold exploits, geographic contributions, and endless brushes with death, Roald Amundsen had inexplicably vanished on June 18 during an effort to rescue the Italian explorer Umberto Nobile, who had himself gone missing in the airship Italia on its return flight from the North Pole. A Norwegian journalist noted tersely in a local Oslo paper, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a terrible thought that the rescue of one explorer might end with the death of another.&#x201d;<br> Louise&#x2019;s first trip north had been an idyllic pleasure cruise a few years earlier. She had sailed with some intrepid friends around the rugged coast of Spitsbergen, Norway, and farther north, close to elusive Franz Josef Land. It was a fulfillment of a childhood dream. During her earlier trip to Spitsbergen, she had been overcome by joy at her first sight of the Arctic Ocean. She was entranced by the deepening silence late at night that was broken only by the heaving and jostling of the massive icebergs, the harsh crispness of the cold air that seared the lungs, that sense of absolute oneness with the primal core of the world. It stirred her blood just to think of it. To be honest, it was also the thrill of the mighty polar-bear hunt that attracted her. Like many adventurous women of her class, she craved the chase, the adrenalin-pumping rush that comes from sighting, stalking, and shooting one of the most fearsome beasts on earth. And she desired the kill as much as any man, when the blood-lust was upon her and the animal fell dead beneath her still-smoking rifle. But more than that, she went north because she wanted to know what was out there. She had to see it for herself. But leading a polar expedition and joining the ranks of fellow American polar explorers such as Elisha Kent Kane, Robert E. Peary, and Richard Byrd? Well, that happened by coincidence &#x2015; or perhaps it was her destiny.<br> Just as the ship left Troms. harbour at the start of the rescue mission, newspaper headlines heralded, &#x201c;Woman Joins Arctic Search &#x2015; Miss Boyd To Assist Rescue&#x201d; and &#x201c;Miss Boyd Confident of Rescue Outlook. Californian Going in Search of Amundsen Is Huntress and Business Woman.&#x201d; Were they really referring to her &#x2015; a forty-year-old sophisticated woman-about-town? Forty! It had taken her quite by surprise.<br> She thought long and hard that year about what she wanted out of life. She wasn&#x2019;t married and had no children &#x2015; no ties at all. Her mother and father had passed away a few years earlier and she&#x2019;d lost both of her brothers when she was young. No family then to judge or criticize or offer loving guidance and support. She was quite alone. There was no one to really care what she did so she just went ahead and did it. In the spring of 1928, her plans to hire a ship and travel north of Norway once more were well under way. But fate intervened when Amundsen was lost. Louise thought about the people closest to her and the pivotal events leading to this critical junction in her life.</p><h2>Conjugating Hindi (American Literature)</h2><p><p>California is still the world's biggest hideout.

He is also a publisher, television producer, songwriter, radio and television commentator, lecturer, and has long been devoted to exploring an alternative black aesthetic: the trickster tradition, or Neo-Hoodooism as he calls it. Founder of the Before Columbus Foundation, he taught at the University of California, Berkeley, for over thirty years, retiring in 2005. In 2003, he received the coveted Otto Award for political theater. He lives in Berkeley, California."One of the most inventive and prolific of contemporary American writers . . . Reed's prose style resembles the youthful Ali's ring style. It is unorthodox, brash, yet controlled." (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"The novel [<i>Conjugating Hindi</i>] is what some academics have dubbed a trickster text, a text informed by the mischievous, shape-shifting, slippery figure of the trickster, found in folklore throughout the world. Implicit in Reed&#x2019;s formal style, as well as his content, is the trickster disregard for caste of any kind. Heedless of boundaries and resistant to being pinned down or hemmed in, the novel is driven almost entirely by Reed&#x2019;s deep, free-wheeling curiosity about why things are the way they are in regard to the use of the model minority myth against Black communities....As the United States&#x2019;s ideals come under increasing attack, we need more flame-throwers like septuagenarian Ishmael Reed &#x2015; more fighters, more tricksters, more eagle-eyed observers with an incendiary spirit, more dazzlingly original artist-writers &#x2015; willing to defy what is permissible to say, willing to catch it on all sides, and willing to run over boundaries of all kinds into genuinely new or neglected territory." (<i>Anita Felicelli, Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"As a top-flight postmodern novelist and feisty cultural critic, Reed consistently challenges our status quo sociopolitical arrangements."

I&#x2019;ve been racking my brains to think of a way of addressing your theme of magic carpets and international perspectives, because I think one should at least try, and I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that although I&#x2019;m not going to say anything directly about that, what I do have to say is as true as I can make it. I&#x2019;m going to talk about responsibility.<br><br> And responsibility is a subject I&#x2019;ve been thinking about a lot recently, because it has a bearing on the way the world is going, and on whether or not our profession, our art or craft, has anything to contribute to the continual struggle to make the world a better place; or whether what we do is, in the last analysis, trivial and irrelevant. Of course, there are several views about the relationship between art and the world, with at one end of the spectrum the Soviet idea that the writer is the engineer of human souls, that art has a social function and had better damn well produce what the state needs, and at the other end the declaration of Oscar Wilde that there is no such thing as a good book or a bad book; books are well written or badly written, that is all; and all art is quite useless. However, it&#x2019;s notable that the book in which he wrote those words as a preface, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, is one of the most moral stories that was ever written, so even Saint Oscar admitted with part of himself that art does have a social and ethical function.&nbsp;<br><br> Anyway, I take it that art, literature, children&#x2019;s literature, do not exist in an ivory tower; I take it that we&#x2019;re inextricably part of the world, the whole world; and that we have several kinds of responsibility that follow from that.&nbsp;<br><br> So that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to talk about briefly this evening&#x2014;the responsibility of the storyteller&#x2014;and how far it extends, and what directions it extends in, and where it stops.&nbsp;<br><br> The first responsibility to talk about is a social and financial one: the sort of responsibility we share with many other citizens&#x2014;the need to look after our families and those who depend on us. People of my age will probably remember that wonderfully terrifying advertisement they used to have for Pearl Assurance. It told a little story which I used to read all the way through every time I saw it. When many years later I learned the meaning of the word catharsis, I realised what it was that I&#x2019;d been feeling as I read that little story: I had been purged by pity and terror.&nbsp;<br><br> The advertisement consisted of five drawings of a man&#x2019;s face. The first was labelled &#x201c;At age 25,&#x201d; and it showed a bright-eyed, healthy, optimistic young fellow, full of pep and vigour, with a speech balloon saying &#x201c;They tell me the job doesn&#x2019;t carry a pension.&#x201d;<br><br> Each succeeding drawing showed him ten years older, and the speech balloons changed with each one. At forty-five, for example, he was looking sombre and lined and heavy with responsibility, and saying &#x201c;Unfortunately, the job is not pensionable.&#x201d; It ended with him at sixty-five: wrinkled, haggard, wild-eyed, a broken-down old man staring into the very abyss of poverty and decrepitude, and saying, &#x201c;Without a pension <i>I really don&#x2019;t know what I shall do!</i>&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Well, I&#x2019;m not going to sell you a pension. I&#x2019;m just going to say that we should all insist that we&#x2019;re properly paid for what we do. We should sell our work for as much as we can decently get for it, and we shouldn&#x2019;t be embarrassed about it. Some tender and sentimental people&#x2014;especially young people&#x2014;are rather shocked when I tell them that I write books to make money, and I want to make a lot, if I can.&nbsp;<br><br> When we start writing books we&#x2019;re all poor; we all have to do another job in the daytime and write at night; and, frankly, it&#x2019;s not as romantic as it seems to those who aren&#x2019;t doing it. Worry&#x2014;constant low-level unremitting anxiety about bank statements and mortgages and bills&#x2014;is not a good state of mind to write in. I&#x2019;ve done it. It drains your energy; it distracts you; it weakens your concentration. The only good thing about being poor and obscure is the obscurity&#x2014;just as the only trouble with being rich and famous is the fame.&nbsp;<br><br> But if we find we can make money by writing books, by telling stories, we have the <i>responsibility</i>&#x2014;the responsibility to our families, and those we look after&#x2014;of doing it as well and as profitably as we can. Here&#x2019;s a useful piece of advice to young writers: cultivate a <i>reputation</i>&#x2014;which need have no basis in reality&#x2014;but cultivate a reputation of being very fond of money. If the people you have to deal with think that you like the folding stuff a great deal, they&#x2019;ll think twice before they offer you very small amounts of it. What&#x2019;s more, by expecting to get paid properly for the work we do, we&#x2019;re helping our fellow writers in their subsequent dealings with schools, or festivals, or prisons, or whatever. I feel not a flicker of shame about declaring that I want as much money for my work as I can get. But, of course, what that money is buying, what it&#x2019;s for, is security, and space, and peace and quiet, and time.&nbsp;<br><br> The next responsibility I want to talk about is the writer&#x2019;s, the storyteller&#x2019;s, responsibility towards language. Once we become conscious of the way language works, and our relationship to it, we can&#x2019;t pretend to be innocent about it; it&#x2019;s not just something that happens to us, and over which we have no influence. If human beings can affect the climate, we can certainly affect the language, and those of us who use it professionally are responsible for looking after it. This is the sort of taking-care-of-the-tools that any good worker tries to instil in an apprentice&#x2014;keeping the blades sharp, oiling the bearings, cleaning the filters.&nbsp;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t have to tell any of you the importance of having a good dictionary, or preferably several. Every writer I know is fascinated by words, and developed the habit of looking things up at a very early age. Words change, they have a history as well as a contemporary meaning; it&#x2019;s worth knowing those things. We should acquire as many reference books as we have space for&#x2014;old and out-of-date ones as well as new ones&#x2014;and make a habit of using them, and take pride in getting things right. The internet also knows a thing or two, but I still prefer books. There&#x2019;s a pleasure in discharging this responsibility&#x2014;of sensing that we&#x2019;re not sure of a particular point of grammar, for example, and in looking it up, and getting it to work properly.&nbsp;<br><br> Sometimes we come across people in our professional lives who think that this sort of thing doesn&#x2019;t matter very much, and it&#x2019;s silly to make a fuss about it. If only a few people recognise and object to a dangling participle, for example, and most readers don&#x2019;t notice and sort of get the sense anyway, why bother to get it right? Well, I discovered a very good answer to that, and it goes like this: if most people don&#x2019;t notice when we get it wrong, <i>they won&#x2019;t mind if we get it right</i>. And if we <i>do </i>get it right, we&#x2019;ll please the few who do know and care about these things, so everyone will be happy.&nbsp;<br><br> A simple example: the thing that annoys me most at the moment is the silly confusion between <i>may </i>and <i>might</i>. &#x201c;Without the code-breaking work at Bletchley Park, Britain may well have lost the Second World War,&#x201d; you hear people say, as if they&#x2019;re not sure whether we did or not. What they mean is, &#x201c;Britain <i>might </i>well have lost the Second World War.&#x201d; They should bloody well learn how to say it. Anyway, when I see someone getting that sort of thing right, I become just a little more sure that I can rely on the language they&#x2019;re using.&nbsp;<br><br> Of course, we can make our <i>characters </i>talk any way we like. It used to be one of the ways in which snobbish writers would mark the difference between characters who were to be admired and those who were to be condescended to. I think we&#x2019;ve grown a little beyond that now; but when a present-day writer hears the difference between &#x201c;bored with&#x201d; and &#x201c;bored of,&#x201d; and uses it with brilliant accuracy to mark not so much a class difference as a generational one, as Neil Gaiman does in his marvellous book <i>Coraline</i>, then he&#x2019;s being responsible to the language in just the way I&#x2019;m talking about.&nbsp;<br><br> As well as taking care of the words, we should take care of the expressions, the idioms. We should become attuned to our own utterances; we should install a little mental bell that rings when we&#x2019;re using expressions that are second-hand or blurred through too much use. We should try always to use language to illuminate, reveal and clarify rather than obscure, mislead and conceal. The language should be safe in our hands&#x2014;safer than it is in those of politicians, for example; at the least, people should be able to say that we haven&#x2019;t left it any poorer, or clumsier, or less precise.&nbsp;<br><br> The aim must always be clarity. It&#x2019;s tempting to feel that if a passage of writing is obscure, it must be very deep. But if the water is murky, the bottom might be only an inch below the surface&#x2014;you just can&#x2019;t tell. It&#x2019;s much better to write in such a way that the readers can see all the way down; but that&#x2019;s not the end of it, because you then have to provide interesting things down there for them to look at. Telling a story involves thinking of some interesting events, putting them in the best order to bring out the connections between them, and telling about them as clearly as we can; and if we get the last part right, we won&#x2019;t be able to disguise any failure with the first&#x2014;which is actually the most difficult, and the most important.&nbsp;<br><br> When it comes to imaginative language, to rich and inventive imagery, we have to beware. But what we have to beware of is too much caution. We must never say to ourselves: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good image&#x2014;very clever; too clever for this book, though&#x2014;save it up for something important.&#x201d; Someone who never did that, someone who put the best of his imagination into everything he wrote, was the great Leon Garfield. Here&#x2019;s a passage from one of my favourites among his books, <i>The Pleasure Garden (1976)</i>:&nbsp;<br><br>"Mrs. Bray was the proprietress of the Mulberry Garden . . . Although a widow for seven years, she still wore black, which lent her bulk a certain mystery; sometimes it was hard to see where she ended and the night began. Dr. Dormann, standing beside her, looked thinner than ever, really no more than a mere slice of a man who might have come off Mrs. Bray in a carelessly slammed door."<br><br> There&#x2019;s fast-food language, and there&#x2019;s caviar language; one of the things we adults need to do for children is to introduce them to the pleasures of the subtle and the complex. One way to do that, of course, is to let them see us enjoying it, and then forbid them to touch it, on the grounds that it&#x2019;s too grown-up for them, their minds aren&#x2019;t ready to cope with it, it&#x2019;s too strong, it&#x2019;ll drive them mad with strange and uncontrollable desires. If that doesn&#x2019;t make them want to try it, nothing will.&nbsp;<br><br> Next in my list of responsibilities comes honesty&#x2014;emotional honesty. We should never try to draw on emotional credit to which our story is not entitled. A few years ago, I read a novel&#x2014;a pretty undistinguished family story&#x2014;which, in an attempt to wring tears from the reader, quite gratuitously introduced a Holocaust theme. The theme had nothing to do with the story&#x2014;it was there for one purpose only, which was to force a particular response and then graft it onto the book. An emotional response from the reader is a precious thing&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the reader&#x2019;s gift to us, in a way; they should be able to trust the stimulus that provokes it. It&#x2019;s perfectly possible&#x2014;difficult, but possible&#x2014;to write an honest story about the Holocaust, or about slavery, or about any of the other terrible things that human beings have done to one another, but that was a dishonest one. Stories should earn their own tears and not pilfer them from elsewhere.&nbsp;<br><br> When it comes to the sheer craft of depicting things, describing them, saying what happened, the film director and playwright David Mamet said something very interesting. He said that the basic storytelling question is: &#x201c;Where do I put the camera?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Thinking about that fascinating, that fathomlessly interesting, question is part of our responsibility towards the craft. Taking cinematography as a metaphor for storytelling, and realising that around every subject there are 360 degrees of space, and an infinity of positions from very close to very far, from very low to very high, at which you can put that camera&#x2014;then it seems that the <i>great</i> director, the great storyteller, knows immediately and without thinking what the best position is, and goes there unhesitatingly. They seem to see it as clearly as we can see that leaves are green.&nbsp;<br><br> A good director will choose one of the half-dozen best positions. A bad director won&#x2019;t know, and will move the camera about, fidgeting with the angles, trying all sorts of tricky shots or fancy ways of telling the story, and forgetting that the function of the camera is not to draw attention to itself, but to show something else&#x2014;the subject&#x2014;with as much clarity as it can manage.&nbsp;<br><br> But actually, the truth is that great directors only <i>seem </i>as if they know the best place at once. The notebooks of great writers and composers are full of hesitations and mistakes and crossings-out; perhaps the real difference is that they<i> keep on</i> till they&#x2019;ve found the best place to put the camera. The responsibility of those of us who are neither very good nor very bad is to imitate the best, to look closely at what they do and try to emulate it, to take the greatest as our models.</p><h2>The Wrong End of the Table: A Mostly Comic Memoir of a Muslim Arab American Woman Just Trying to Fit in</h2><p><b>"[A] rare voice that is both relatable and unafraid to examine the complexities of her American identity.</b>&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Reza Aslan, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth</i><br><br> An Immigrant Love-Hate Story of What it Means to Be American</b><br><br> You know that feeling of being at the wrong end of the table?

So argues the economist Richard Davies, who takes readers to the margins of the modern economy and beyond in his globe-trotting book. From a prison in rural Louisiana where inmates purchase drugs with prepaid cash cards to the poorest major city on earth, where residents buy clean water in plastic bags, from the world&#x2019;s first digital state to a prefecture in Japan whose population is the oldest in the world, how these extreme economies function&#x2015;most often well outside any official oversight&#x2015;offers a glimpse of the forces that underlie human resilience, drive societies to failure, and will come to shape our collective future.</p><p>While the people who inhabit these places have long been dismissed or ignored, <i>Extreme Economies</i> revives a foundational idea from medical science to turn the logic of modern economics on its head, arguing that the outlier economies are the place to learn about our own future. Whether following Punjabi migrants through the lawless Panamanian jungle or visiting a day-care for the elderly modeled after a casino, Davies brings a storyteller&#x2019;s eye to places where the economy has been destroyed, distorted, and even turbocharged. In adapting to circumstances that would be unimaginable to most of us, the people he encounters along the way have helped to pioneer the economic infrastructure of the future.</p><p>At once personal and keenly analytical, <i>Extreme Economies</i> is an epic travelogue for the age of global turbulence, shedding light on today&#x2019;s most pressing economic questions.</p></p><p>Richard Davies is a British economist and journalist. He is a fellow at the London School of Economics, and has served as economic adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers at HM Treasury. He also served as the economics editor of <i>The Economist.</i></p><h2>Patterns In The Mind</h2><p>What is it about the human mind that accounts for the fact that we can speak and understand a language? Why can&#39;t other creatures do the same? And what does this tell us about the rest of human abilities? Recent dramatic discoveries in linguistics and psychology provide intriguing answers to these age-old mysteries. In this fascinating book, Ray Jackendoff emphasizes the grammatical commonalities across languages, both spoken and signed, and discusses the implications for our understanding of language acquisition and loss.</p><p><b>Ray Jackendoff,</b> linguist and theoretical psychologist, is professor of linguistics at Brandeis University. He is the author of several books, including <i>Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar</i>, <i>Semantics and Cognition</i>,<i> Consciousness and the Computational Mind</i>, and <i>Semantic Structures</i>.In a challenging, timely, and persuasive argument, Jackendoff (Brandeis; the scholarly Semantics and Cognition, 1983--not reviewed) proposes that language and, by extension, music and visual experience in part culturally engendered--but that, fundamentally, they're expressions of innate, perhaps even genetic, properties of the brain. Redressing the balance between nature and nurture to explain language, Jackendoff contends that language acquisition, a fundamental characteristic of humanity, depends on a universal mental grammar--a set of unconscious grammatical principles that condition the organization, production, and reception of human speech--that's a form of innate knowledge. Considering the ways in which children acquire language (understanding more than they can say, generating speech they haven't heard); American sign language (of which he offers a brief and cogent history); and the learning- impaired and language-deprived, he explores the concepts of this universal grammar. Jackendoff proposes a physiological basis for language in a specialized area of the brain, which can be identified even though its organization is still a mystery. He then extends these principles of universal grammar and innate knowledge to the understanding of music, visual signs, and, most challenging, social interaction. Meaning is ``constructed'' by the innate patterns of the auditor as well as by the speaker, he says, and, by extension, human experience of the world is ``constructed by'' similar unconscious principles--principles that, unlike Freud's unconscious, can never be brought into awareness. In his discussion of semantics, Jackendoff distinguishes between language and thought, between grammar and concept, and between the translatable and the untranslatable, emphasizing human interaction and its implications for society. A powerful, direct, and tidy argument that vindicates Jackendoff's initial purpose: to make linguistics ``part of every educated individual's intellectual repertoire.'' -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A half-century after the event it is surely time to demonstrate, once and for all, that RFK's <i>Thirteen Days</i> and the personal memoirs of other ExComm members cannot be taken seriously as historically accurate accounts of the ExComm meetings.</p></p><p>Sheldon M. Stern taught U.S. history at the college level for more than a decade before becoming historian at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts from 1977 to 2000. He was the first non-member of the ExComm, as well as the first historian, to listen to and evaluate all the secret White House tape recordings made during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Stern is the author of <i>Averting the Final Failure: John F. Kennedy and the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis Meetings</i> (2003), and <i>The Week the World Stood Still: Inside the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis</i> (2005), both in the Stanford University Press Nuclear Age Series."[Stern's] new book marshals irrefutable evidence to succinctly demolish the mythic version of the crisis . . . Reached through sober analysis." (Benjamin Schwarz <i><i>The Atlantic</i></i>)<br><br>"The latest addition to the outstanding Stanford Nuclear Age series . . . Informed and informative, <i>The Cuban Missile Crisis in American Memory: Myths versus Reality</i> is a seminal work of impressive scholarship and a highly recommended addition to academic library 20th Century American History reference collections in general, and 'U.S. &#x2013; Soviet Union Cold War Studies' supplemental reading lists in particular." (James A. Cox <i><i>The Midwest Book Review</i></i>)<br><br>"In Stern's judgment, President Kennedy displayed leadership, remaining calm during the crisis and staring down his belligerent civilian advisers and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. . . Recommended." (S. G. Rabe <i><i>CHOICE</i></i>)<br><br>"Stern is not alone in questioning the precision of the transcripts offered, but he has made the most painstaking attempt to clarify what was really said and done." (Alice George <i><i>Journal of American History</i></i>)<br><br>"Stern's book is a great example of how much is being discovered and revised regarding the Cold War and its major events as more archival sources are declassified. This work is a must read for any scholar of the Cuban missile crisis or the Kennedy administration. It provides a complicated and broad understanding of both the crisis and the Kennedy presidency." (Javan D. Frazier <i><i>H-War</i></i>)<br><br>"The Cuban missile crisis may be the most thoroughly documented yet grossly misunderstood episode in Cold War history, and the value of Sheldon Stern's splendid book is that it punctures the myths and unearths the truth so compellingly, drawing on irrefutable evidence, that you'll never think about the crisis or about JFK and his 'best and brightest' advisers in the same way again." (Fred Kaplan <i><i>Slate</i>'s "War Stories" columnist; author of <i>1959</i> and <i>The Wizards of Armageddon</i></i>)<br><br>"It has taken nearly 50 years to get a history of the Cuban missile crisis as it really was, as opposed to how it was initially (and for many decades) managed and manipulated by the Kennedy inner circle as well as gullible journalists and historians. For that we have Sheldon M. Stern to thank." (Max Holland <i>Contributing Editor, <i>The Nation</i>, and Editor, washingtondecoded.com</i>)<br><br>"Timed for the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Stern. . . exposes myths about the crisis. [He] provides an important interpretation grounded in careful research." (Karl Helicher <i><i>Library Journal</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>The Cuban Missile Crisis in American Memory</i> offers a compelling reassessment of [the] events [of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis]. Using tapes of ExComm meetings (the ad hoc group formed to meet the crisis), Stern challenges much of the received wisdom. In particular, he rejects Robert F. Kennedy's dovish self-portrayal in <i>Thirteen Days</i> (1969), finding instead a consistent hardliner who, for instance, opposed an American naval blockade in favor of air strikes." (James Clyde Sellman <i><i>Colloquy</i></i>)<br><br>"For nearly half a century national security decision makers have relied on three lessons derived inappropriately from the Cuban missile crisis: success depends on (1) the threat of superior force, (2) toughness and inflexibility, and (3) the use of a small ad hoc group like the ExComm to advise the President. Sheldon Stern's trenchant analysis, based on the most careful and exacting review to date of the ExComm's recorded conversations, turns the three traditional missile crisis lessons on their head. He effectively demonstrates that the outcome depended on President Kennedy's repeated refusal to use or threaten to use force, and on his persistent search for a compromise that could end the stand-off peacefully. Most important, Stern highlights that the ExComm did not provide Kennedy with the well-considered advice he supposedly used to avoid war, but instead Kennedy directed its discussions towards the conclusions he sought. This is a clearly written, timely, and significant contribution to our understanding of the Cuban missile crisis."

It&#39;s the first of several to wash up along the surrounding coast, and not long after, the holy brothers stumble across the smouldering ruins of a bardic school with a pile of decapitated bodies inside. Only one survivor, barely alive, is found hiding nearby. He is Cian Brydydd Mawr, the greatest bard of his age, who holds in his head the four `branches&#39; of an ancient, epic Welsh myth cycle: The Mabinogion. Physically weak but strong willed, he asks the monks to put aside their rigid Christian doctrine and commit his oral tales to parchment - before the stories of spirits and shape-shifters, giants and time-travellers, curses and spells, are lost forever...</p><p>Hugh Lupton, one of the most prominent figures in the Oral Storytelling Tradition, is an internationally renowned performer, song-writer and novelist.The Assembly of The Severed Head makes demands,as well it might,of its readers.We must agree to fall into step with what is primarily an oral prose poem.We must tune in to its incantatory voice.We must accept that the colour of the novel lies essentially within the vivid action of the four caincs, for all the vivid and inventive envelopes of scene setting.But then, what extraordinary rewards! Here is a truly memorable novel, possibly a great one, standing at the intersection of the oral and the written.A monk in a Cistercian monastery painstakingly writes down on calfskin the stunning stories of the Mabinogion,the Matter of Wales,dictated to him by an old court bard,Cian Brydydd Mawr.Anxious that he may be forfeiting his place in heaven by doing do, he nevertheless also comes to see the remarkable parallels between Christianity and the old stories.This is the novel that Lupton was born to write and perhaps only he could have written.It&#39;s underpinned by a long and wise understanding of the oral tradition and of the Mabinogion,and it is by turns spiritual,magical,passionate,tender,visceral and gory.It is beautifully crafted.And its backbone is a humane engagement with the power and function of story.Kevin Crossley-Holland.</p><h2>The Field of Vision (Bison Book S)</h2><p>Winner of the National Book Award &#34;Wright Morris seems to me the most important novelist of the American middle generation.

Boys are conditioned from an early age to 'be a real man.' This book is essential to anyone who wants to understand what is meant by toxic masculinity. My experiences were different than Sexton's, but I saw myself and my father in these pages, and its frightening. The problem is vast, but Sexton points out how to heal and move forward." &#x2015;Myles Mickle, Village Square Booksellers (Bellows Falls, VT) <br><br><b>Praise for <i>The People Are Going to Rise Like the Waters Upon Your Shore</i></b><br><br> "An impressionistic and often disturbing account of the 2016 presidential race . . . Sexton grapples with the Trump campaign from the perspective of the crowds reveling in the candidate&#x2019;s presence and message. It is a useful vantage point given the increasingly blatant bigotry in the months since the election . . . This book reveals the incremental nature of public displays of hatred, growing from harsh chants and bumper stickers to, say, an open and unmasked gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville . . . [His] dispatches are bracing." &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post </i><br><br> "This is the post-campaign book I was waiting for. Nothing else has shown me so clearly the ruptures in our culture aligned with Trump's candidacy, or even the nature of the way we choose a president. Essential reading for understanding this country now and going forward." &#x2015;Alexander Chee, author of <i>The Queen of the Night</i><br><br> "Jared Yates Sexton didn't just randomly become a phenomenon in his chronicling of Donald Trump's fans and foibles, it happened because he's our Jane Goodall to Trump's Deplorables. His work has been indispensable to those who have tried to understand our times, with an honesty lacking among most of our mainstream media. Read this book." &#x2015;Cliff Schecter, bestselling author of <i>The Real McCain: Why Conservatives Don't Trust Him&#x2015;And Why Independents Shouldn't</i> and a columnist for <i>The Daily Beast </i><br><br> "Jared Yates Sexton ventured into the dark heart of American partisanship and emerged with a warning that all of us would do well to heed. Thoughtful, compassionate, and exceptionally brave, this book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how&#x2015;and why&#x2015;our country turned on itself." &#x2015;Bronwen Dickey, author of <i>Pit Bull: The Battle over an American Icon </i><br><br> "Sexton&#x2019;s first-person account is both candidly relatable and viscerally frightening . . . [His] seamless blending of his reporter&#x2019;s objectivity with the personal evaluations of a voter who has skin in the game yields trenchant analysis . . . Sexton&#x2019;s is a critical and important voice in helping readers understand the cultural and political sea change the election created." &#x2015;<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)<br><br> "A leftist counterweight to <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i>, laced with shots of Hunter S. Thompson . . . A useful snapshot of a tumultuous presidential race." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews </i><br><br> "Sexton's reporting provides a unique nuts-and-bolts look at the campaigns, and his eyewitness reports of the aggressive displays at Trump rallies are both terrifying and fascinating." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly </i><br><br> "First of all, this is the best book title of 2017, hands down. Second, and more importantly, this is the book to read if you want to understand what the hell happened in the United States in 2016. If you follow Sexton on Twitter (and you should), you know he brings a sharp eye, fierce intellect, and resilient capacity for surprise to the problem of American political life.

Just imagine what he can do with 300+ pages." &#x2015;Book Riot<br><br> "<i>The People Are Going to Rise</i> is a comprehensive chronicle of the 2016 campaign from the margins . . . Even with the fresh-hell fatigue of following the resulting administration, and with that campaign still in recent memory, revisiting it with Sexton lets you see the horror anew, with a deeper sense of its consequences. And as the water level rises higher on the shore, Sexton continues to be a dutiful correspondent." &#x2015;<i>Black Warrior Review </i><br><br> "<i>The People Are Going to Rise Like the Waters Upon Your Shore</i> encapsulates what this election was and what it meant to be watching.

There's a unique value in ignoring postmortems and what-ifs and instead drilling right to the center of America, to the fracturing, raging heart of our nation, and forcing oneself not to look away.

However, it is only the latest chapter in a history of illicit business dealings that stretches back to 1848, when attempts by Mexico and the United States to tax commerce across the Rio Grande upset local trade and caused popular resentment. Rather than acquiesce to what they regarded as arbitrary trade regulations, borderlanders continued to cross goods and accepted many forms of smuggling as just.</p><p>In <i>Border Contraband</i>, George T. D�az provides the first history of the common, yet little studied, practice of smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border. In Part I, he examines the period between 1848 and 1910, when the United States' and Mexico's trade concerns focused on tariff collection and on borderlanders' attempts to avoid paying tariffs by smuggling. Part II begins with the onset of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, when national customs and other security forces on the border shifted their emphasis to the interdiction of prohibited items (particularly guns and drugs) that threatened the state. D�az's pioneering research explains how greater restrictions have transformed smuggling from a low-level mundane activity, widely accepted and still routinely practiced, into a highly profitable professional criminal enterprise.</p></p><p>George T. D�az is Assistant Professor of History at Sam Houston State University."Far from Washington, DC, and Mexico City, borderlanders smuggled licit and illicit products. While bureaucrats attempted to control the smugglers, they were celebrated in popular culture, and some rose to be pillars of their communities. In a well-researched, accessible, and engaging study, George D�az documents the ebb and flow of an array of commodities and the lives of those who subverted federal laws, whether for profit or survival, on both sides of the border." (Elaine Carey, St. John's University, author of Women Drug Traffickers: Mules, Bosses, and Organized Crime)<br><br>"This book addresses a major border subject that has long been neglected by scholars, a neglect that is largely explained by the difficulty of researching an illegal activity such as smuggling. George D�az has done a commendable job of unearthing source materials both in the United States and Mexico that shed light on the subject. The book is well written, interesting, and informative, and is well illustrated by many examples of individual smugglers and contrabandista activities. . . . It will be very useful to scholars, students, and general readers." (Oscar J. Mart�nez, Regents&#x2019; Professor of History, University of Arizona)<br><br>"Border Contraband finds that borderlanders in the Laredo&#x2013;Nuevo Laredo area accepted everyday illegal smuggling when the practice benefited bargain-conscious consumers. At the same time, however, community values discountenanced the smuggling of alcohol and guns, for such trafficking attracted organized crime. To document this understudied phenomenon, George D�az draws on solid primary sources deposited in some of the richest archives in Mexico and the United States. Kudos to this first work by an up-and-coming young historian." (Arnoldo De Le�n, Angelo State University)<br><br>"Border Contraband: A History of Smuggling across the Rio Grande provides one the first full-length historical monographs that historicizes the changing practices and perceptions of everyday smuggling between Mexico and the United States over the course of a century. In this fascinating analysis of &#x2018;common smuggling&#x2019; between Texas and Northeastern Mexico, historian George T. D�az illustrates how these two states attempted to control and regulate &#x2018;illicit trade&#x2019; between these border locales, and how everyday people subverted state and federal efforts to impinge upon what many considered to be part and parcel of a broader &#x2018;moral economy.&#x2019; Those looking to contextualize the genealogy of smuggling along the U.S.-Mexico border would be wise to consider pondering these questions with a reading of Border Contraband." (Jos� Angel Hern�ndez, Associate Professor of History, University of Houston)<br><br>"Here&#x2019;s the book I've been waiting for: a well-researched history of the clandestine side of U.S.-Mexico trade relations. Today&#x2019;s heated debates about an out-of-control border too often suffer from historical amnesia. D�az has given us a much-needed historical corrective and reality check, reminding us that the border has never actually been under control."

Broad takes us on an adventure to the planet's last and most exotic frontier -- the depths of the sea. <i>The Universe Below</i> examines how we are illuminating its dark recesses as a wave of advanced technology quietly opens the Earth's largest and most mysterious environment. <br>Broad takes us on breathtaking dives and expeditions -- to the Azores, to the <i>Titanic</i>, to hot springs teeming with bizarre life, to icy fissures aswarm with gulper eels, vampire squids, and gelatinous beasts longer than a city bus. We meet legendary explorers and researchers and go with them as they probe the ancient mysteries of a universe that encompasses the vast majority of the Earth's habitable space and holds millions of humanity's lost artworks and treasures. <br><i>The Universe Below</i> is an unforgettable trip to our last great unexplored frontier.</p><p>Many people realize that the ocean covers some two-thirds of the earth's surface (the actual figure is 71 percent). But as William J. Broad points out in his entrancing <i>The Universe Below</i>, this hardly tells the story of the sea's dominance of our planet. The world's oceans are more than two miles deep on average and, contrary to long-held views, are richly populated with life all the way to the bottom. So, in fact, the sea probably makes up something like 97 percent of all inhabited space on Earth--we surface dwellers are almost an afterthought.<p>"This book is about the largest unexplored part of our planet, the deep sea," writes Broad in his prologue, "and how we are illuminating its dark recesses in a rush of discovery that is shattering old myths, rescuing lost treasures, and laying bare secrets of nature hidden since the beginning of geologic time." In seven chapters, each devoted to a different aspect of deep exploration and discovery, Broad weaves together scrupulous reporting and scientific explication (he has won two Pulitzers for his science writing for the <i>New York Times</i>) along with history and his own personal experiences, all told in vigorous, intelligent prose that often rises to a quiet poetry. The result is one of the most enthralling science books of the decade. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p>The deep sea is teeming with life, most of which has gone unseen by human eyes. Scientists are beginning to explore this fascinating realm of unusual sea creatures and volatile volcanos, using once-secret military technology now freed up by the end of the Cold War. See the timeline for a short history of this. In the Universe Below, William Broad takes a fresh look at this recent surge of exploration and discovery, and brings his readers along on some of his journeys into the deep. <p>In 1993, author William Broad joined scientists on a two-week expedition off the Oregon/Washington coast. Their aim was to examine the Juan de Fuca Ridge and to study how volcanic heat spawns life on the ocean floor. The crew voyaged 250 miles off-shore on a 210-feet long carrier ship, The Atlantis II, which each day lowered three members 1.5 miles into the deep via Alvin, a 25-feet long submersible vessel. <br>* * *<br> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td>Links </td><td>Meet Alvin<br> Garden of Eden<br> Chimneys of the Deep Sea<br> A Brief Chronology of Sea Exploration<br> </td></tr></tbody></table> <br>* * *<br> <p>Pulitzer Prize winner William J. Broad takes us on an epic journey to the planet's last and most exotic frontier -- the depths of the sea. The Universe Below examines how we are illuminating its dark recesses in a rush of discovery, uncovering hidden worlds of alien creatures, living fossils, lost treasures, precious metals, and perhaps even the place where life itself first arose billions of years ago. </p><p>Broad takes us on breathtaking dives and expeditions -- to the Azores, to the Titanic,., to hot springs teeming with bizarre life, to icy fissures aswarm with gulper eels, vampire squids, and gelatinous beasts longer than a city bus. We meet legendary explorers at the forefront of deep research and go with them as they probe the ancient mysteries of the deep. This universe below encompasses the vast majority of the Earth's habitable space and nurtures perhaps ten times as many species of life as are known on land. Broad shows that the abyss also holds millions of humanity's lost artworks and treasures -- more than all the world's museums combined. Yet, remarkably, human eyes up to now have glimpsed perhaps only a billionth of this unfamiliar realm, a place of crushing pressure and eternal darkness. </p><p>Drawing on extensive fieldwork, including hundreds of talks and interviews, Broad takes us to the cutting edge of the exploratory surge and reveals how it is powered by a wave of once-secret technologies. At a cost of untold billions, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and othercold-war contestants forged these marvels to spy and fight and plunder the deep. Today, these wonders and the poeple who made and ran them are catalyzing an unprecedented speedup in civilian efforts to illuminate the inky depths. </p><p>Broad shows how the rush into the deep is revealing not only great mysteries and riches but great dangers as well, including the deadly radioactive debris of the cold war. Deep pollution, mining, and fishing threaten this frontier with ecological upset and species extinction. We will either destroy the sea through ignorance or save it, and ourselves, with the kinds of knowledge we are now gaining in the exploratory speedup. </p><p>The Universe Below is an unforgettable journey to the universe in our own backyard.</p></p><h2>Bataan Death March: A Survivor&#39;s Account</h2><p>The hopeless yet determined resistance of American and Filipino forces against the Japanese invasion has made Bataan and Corregidor symbols of pride, but Bataan has a notorious darker side. After the U.S.-Filipino remnants surrendered to a far stronger force, they unwittingly placed themselves at the mercy of a foe who considered itself unimpaired by the Geneva Convention. The already ill and hungry survivors, including many wounded, were forced to march at gunpoint many miles to a harsh and oppressive POW camp; many were murdered or died on the way in a nightmare of wanton cruelty that has made the term "Death March" synonymous with the Bataan peninsula. Among the prisoners was army pilot William E. Dyess. With a few others, Dyess escaped from his POW camp and was among the very first to bring reports of the horrors back to a shocked United States. His story galvanized the nation and remains one of the most powerful personal narratives of American fighting men. Stanley L. Falk provides a scene-setting introduction for this Bison Books edition. <p>William E. Dyess was born in Albany, Texas. As a young army air forces pilot he was shipped to Manila in the spring of 1941. Shortly after his escape and return to the United States, Colonel Dyess was killed while testing a new airplane. He did not survive long enough to learn that he had been awarded a Congressional Medal of Honor.</p></p><p>Stanley L.

It&#39;s true he went to America and fell in love with Lucille, the daughter of a millionaire hotel proprietor . . . and if he did marry her -- well, what else was there to do? From his point of view, the whole thing was a thoroughly good egg; but Mr. Brewster, his father-in-law, thought differently, Archie had neither money nor occupation, which was distasteful in the eyes of the industrious Mr. Brewster; but the real bar was the fact that he had once adversely criticized one of his hotels. Archie did his best to heal the breach; but, being something of an ass, genus priceless, he found it almost beyond his powers to placate the &#34;man-eating fish&#34; whom Providence had given him as a father-in-law. . . .</p><p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (P. G. Wodehouse) was an English humorist and writer best known for his Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels. Educated at boarding schools, Wodehouse turned to writing at a young age, demonstrating great skill at humorous sketches and musical lyrics. He continued to write part-time while pursuing, at the behest of his father, a career in banking, and successfully contributed numerous pieces to Punch, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Express, among other publications. In addition to his literary work, Wodehouse was incorporated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in recognition of his collaboration with Cole Porter on Anything Goes, his lyrics to the song Bill from Show Boat, and his work on the musicals Rosalie and The Three Musketeers.<p>While interned along with other British citizens in Germany during the Second World War, Wodehouse made a series of radio broadcasts for which he was accused of being a collaborator; and, although later cleared of the charges, he never returned to England. His work has influenced many other writers including Evelyn Waugh, Rudyard Kipling, J. K. Rowling, and John Le Carr?. P. G. Wodehouse died in 1975 at the age of 93.</p>Frederick Davidson may not be the best interpreter of P.G. Wodehouse's comic masterpieces, but he's not the worst and is assuredly the most active, with at least 25 Wodehouse titles under his belt. He is, in fact, one of the most popular and active readers in the general audiobook field. He reads with a dry British accent, low-key and almost drawling. His great weakness is that he enunciates all young women with the same breathy, indistinguishably vapid intonation. With men, on the other hand, he offers a wide interpretation, some quite funny as he portrays such personality traits as growling irascibility or stumbling befuddlement. Luckily for him here, there are few female characters. Author Wodehouse began publishing books in 1902 and died in 1975 after having been named a Knight of the British Empire. The present book first appeared in 1921 at a time when Wodehouse was at least as well known for his collaborative work in America as a playwright. As usual with Wodehouse, misunderstandings and coincidences abound. This is solid entertainment, recommended for public libraries.?Don Wismer, Cary Memorial Lib, Wayne, Me.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Taking Haiti: Military Occupation and the Culture of U.S. Imperialism, 1915-1940</h2><p>The U.S. invasion of Haiti in July 1915 marked the start of a military occupation that lasted for nineteen years--and fed an American fascination with Haiti that flourished even longer. Exploring the cultural dimensions of U.S. contact with Haiti during the occupation and its aftermath, Mary Renda shows that what Americans thought and wrote about Haiti during those years contributed in crucial and unexpected ways to an emerging culture of U.S. imperialism.<br><br>At the heart of this emerging culture, Renda argues, was American paternalism, which saw Haitians as wards of the United States. She explores the ways in which diverse Americans--including activists, intellectuals, artists, missionaries, marines, and politicians--responded to paternalist constructs, shaping new versions of American culture along the way. Her analysis draws on a rich record of U.S. discourses on Haiti, including the writings of policymakers; the diaries, letters, songs, and memoirs of marines stationed in Haiti; and literary works by such writers as Eugene O'Neill, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, and Zora Neale Hurston.<br><br>Pathbreaking and provocative, <i>Taking Haiti</i> illuminates the complex interplay between culture and acts of violence in the making of the American empire.<br><br></p><p>"[A] significant and exciting contribution to this growing interdisciplinary field. . . .

Jende has arrived from Cameroon, and after a stint working as a dishwasher he lands a job as the driver for Clark Edwards, an executive who is reaping a fortune at the soon-to-be doomed Lehman Brothers. Jende is poor, living in Harlem, but with his new job he is able to move his wife and son to New York&#x2014;he feels he is on the fast track to his American dream. Clark is rich, but has troubles of his own, and conversations in the car&#x2014;private ones between Jende and members of the Edwards family, talks overheard on cell phones&#x2014;begin to reveal these fissures. In this wonderful debut novel, we watch events unfold for both families in ways that suggest the American dream might be more fragile than advertised. Mbue is a master of presenting a scene and allowing the reader to see between the lines; the result is the thrill of feeling that, for one of those rare times, we might be able to accurately imagine what it&#x2019;s like to be someone different from ourselves. <em>--Chris Schluep, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Imbolo Mbue </b>is a native of the seaside town of Limbe, Cameroon.

This is the original 'scrupulously faithful' translation by Father Frederick William Faber. The great Marian Pope, Blessed Pope John Paul II practised this Devotion to Mary, in his Letter to the Montfort Fathers he says:</p> <p>"A work destined to become a classic of Marian spirituality was published 160 years ago. St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort wrote the Treatise on True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin at the beginning of the 1700s, but the manuscript remained practically unknown for more than a century. When, almost by chance, it was at last discovered in 1842 and published in 1843, the work was an instant success, proving extraordinarily effective in spreading the "true devotion" to the Most Holy Virgin."</p> <p>"My motto; 'Totus Tuus' is inspired by the teaching of St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort. These two words express total belonging to Jesus through Mary: 'Tuus totus ego sum, et omnia mea tua sunt', St Louis Marie wrote, and he translates his words: 'I am all yours, and all that I have is yours, O most loving Jesus, through Mary, your most holy Mother' (Treatise on True Devotion, n. 233). This Saint's teaching has had a profound influence on the Marian devotion of many of the faithful and on my own life. It is a lived teaching of outstanding ascetic and mystical depth, expressed in a lively and passionate style that makes frequent use of images and symbols."</p> <p>"All our perfection", St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort writes, "consists in being conformed, united and consecrated to Jesus Christ; and therefore, the most perfect of all devotions is, without any doubt, that which most perfectly conforms, unites and consecrates us to Jesus Christ. Now, Mary being the most conformed of all creatures to Jesus Christ, it follows that, of all devotions, that which most consecrates and conforms the soul to Our Lord is devotion to his holy Mother, and that the more a soul is consecrated to Mary, the more it is consecrated to Jesus (Treatise on True Devotion, n. 120)."</p> <p>"When we praise her, love her, honour her or give anything to her, it is God who is praised, God who is loved, God who is glorified, and it is to God that we give, through Mary and in Mary (Treatise on True Devotion, n. 225)."</p> <p>Saint Louis-Marie Grignon De Montfort was a Catholic Priest and Missionary in Brittany and Vendee, France. He was born in Montfort-sur-Meu in 1673 and died in 1716. He was canonized by Pius XII in 1947. His feast day is on April 28th. He is considered one of the early proponents of the field of Mariology as it is known today, and a candidate to become a Doctor of the Church.</p> <p>This EDC Edition includes additional religious illustrations.</p> <p>PUBLISHER: CATHOLIC WAY PUBLISHING</p><p></p></p><p>For those of the Catholic faith who enjoy reading the Catholic classics and wonderful Catholic books that are hard to find in other places, you&#39;ll find yourself enthusiastic with Catholic Way Publishing, who exist to supply you with these glorious works.

In this compelling new book, Girard ties the anorexia epidemic to what he calls mimetic desire: a desire imitated from a model. Girard has long argued that, far from being spontaneous, our most intimate desires are copied from what we see around us. In a culture obsessed with thinness, the rise of eating disorders should be no surprise. When everyone is trying to slim down, Girard asks, how can we convince anorexic patients to have a healthy outlook on eating? Mixing theoretical sophistication with irreverent common sense, Girard denounces a &#x201c;culture of anorexia&#x201d; and takes apart the competitive impulse that fuels the game of conspicuous non-consumption. He shows that showing off a slim physique is not enough&#x2014;the real aim is to be skinnier than one&#x2019;s rivals. In the race to lose the most weight, the winners are bound to be thinner and thinner. Taken to extremes, this tendency to escalation can only lead to tragic results. Featuring a foreword by neuropsychiatrist Jean-Michel Oughourlian and an introductory essay by anthropologist Mark R. Anspach, the volume concludes with an illuminating conversation between Ren� Girard, Mark R. Anspach, and Laurence Tacou.</p><p><p> Ren� Girard is a member of the French Academy, Emeritus Professor at Stanford University, and the author of several books that have been translated worldwide.

Now that her father has passed on, leaving behind a mountain of debt, Miranda must do the unthinkable. For Ethan has promised to sponsor her younger sisters, financially and socially, at a scandalously dear price: Miranda must offer herself to him completely for three full months, with no remorse and no restraints. </p> <p> Ninety days and nights of unbridled sensuality await her in the arms of a rogue who views her submission as no more than a grand erotic game. But neither Miranda nor Ethan realize that fire blazes behind her innocent blush. And once her passion is unleashed by his lips and his touch, it is the student who will school the teacher in the ways of forbidden pleasure . . . and love. </p></p><p>Jess Michaels is the USA Today Bestselling author of nearly 70 books.</p><h2>Medicine in Translation: Journeys with My Patients</h2><p><b>From a doctor Oliver Sacks has called a &#x201c;born storyteller,&#x201d; a riveting account of practicing medicine at a fast-paced urban hospital</b><br> &nbsp;<br>For two decades, Dr. Danielle Ofri has cared for patients at Bellevue, the oldest public hospital in the country and a crossroads for the world&#x2019;s cultures.

Reports of iconic beasts and mysterious carcasses filter down from the mountains, while something the newspapers call &#x201c;The Bosque Bigfoot&#x201d; is killing cows down by the Rio Grande.</p><p>Soon the world&#x2019;s attention will be fastened on the wildlands of New Mexico, as more than the fate of a single native species is at stake. In his first novel, acclaimed natural history and travel writer Stephen J Bodio, whose 1988 memoir Querencia depicted the landscape and ways of southern New Mexico, and gave many readers their first glimpse of this faraway country, imagines the rebirth of big predators like the grizzlies and jaguar, in his own back yard. All too often discussions of &#x201c;re-wilding&#x201d; are abstract, with little thought for their unfolding in the real world, as though the country were a park. In Tiger Country, the effects are real. As viewpoints and people collide, the media, ranchers, naturalists, activists, politicians, and ordinary people must take their stands in the real world, not just in theory. Respectful of all the actors, especially the non-human ones, and in debt to none, Bodio shows the heartbreak of unintended consequences.</p><p>At times suspenseful, lyrical, hair-raising, and even funny it is a worthy fiction debut, and Bodio is uniquely qualified to tell it. Biologist, falconer, dog breeder, literary critic, and hunter, born in Boston but a rural New Mexico resident for almost forty years, he knows the wildlife, people, and cultures of his chosen Querencia.</p><p>Malcolm Brooks, author of Painted Horses, says: &#x201c;Steve Bodio brings his legendary Renaissance vision to this startling first novel, a work so mammoth in scope and elegant in execution it makes me wish he&#x2019;d been writing fiction all along. Recalling the edgy best of Ed Abbey and Jim Harrison, and reminiscent of James Carlos Blake&#x2019;s contemporary border noir, Tiger Country throws modern heroic renegades into the gravitational pull of the ancient past, to encounter the origins of the human condition.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Stephen Bodio was born in Boston in 1950. He studied Biology and English literature for years at both Universities of Massachusetts without ever quite managing to get his degree. He has lived in a remote rural village in New Mexico for over thirty years, and has traveled extensively in Europe, Africa, and especially Asia. He has published eleven books, and has been editor and anthologist of more, as well as a frequent contributor to magazines. He has been on the masthead of publications as various as the scholarly quarterly English Literary Renaissance and the upscale outdoor magazine Gray&#39;s Sporting Journal, where he wrote a book column for eleven years. His articles, essays, and stories have appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, Smithsonian, Sports Illustrated, and the LA Times Magazine, and in literary quarterlies. He has a lifelong interest in birds, their behavior, and their relations with humans, as reflected in his books on falcons and pigeons. He has hunted with falcons for almost fifty years, kept rare pigeon breeds, and has bred and trained saluki dogs and their Asian relatives for thirty. He assisted Russian scientist and dog expert Vladimir Beregovoy with his translation of a 19th century Russian hunter&#39;s memoir, Notes of an East Siberian Hunter. Since then he has written An Eternity of Eagles, a profusely illustrated volume he describes as &#34;a natural and social history of all the many kinds of eagles, their evolution, diversity and habits; our relations with them, friendly and unfriendly, from falconry to shooting them from planes.&#34; He has also contributed text and introductions to many works about and by artists, including Alan James Robinson, Thomas Quinn, Vadim Gorbatov, and Thomas Aquinas Daly. Bodio&#39;s most unusual work is what he calls &#34;The Book of Books,&#34; actually titled A Sportsman&#39;s Library, and accurately subtitled &#34;100 Essential, Engaging, Offbeat, and Occasionally Odd Fishing and Hunting Books for the Adventurous Reader.&#34; It contains a falconry manual by a medieval emperor, a how-to fly-fish comic book, a seventeenth century poem on wingshooting, and the autobiography of a rat hunter. Well-known writers-Karen Blixen, Hemingway, Ted Hughes, T H White-share space with many lesser known, undeservedly forgotten, or just strange ones-Brian Plummer (Tales of a Rat Hunting Man); Theresa Maggio (Mattanza); Geoffrey Household (Dance of the Dwarfs); and both Setons. And of course, eighty-eight more. Bodio claims he can easily find another hundred, and will, for another collection tentatively titled .&#34;..With Trees&#34; after the apocryphal story about the editor who rejected Norman MacLean&#39;s A River Runs Through It with the remark &#34;This book has TREES in it!&#34; Another Asian book, The Hounds of Heaven, is about his travels in Kazakhstan where he found his dogs, the ancient saluki-like tazis of Central Asia. Of it, writer, blogger, and former actor Jameson Parker says: &#34;Steve Bodio is one of America&#39;s greatly underrated treasures. He writes like an angel about a wide range of fascinating topics; he is one of the most widely-read and well-educated men I have ever come across, a twenty-first century version of an eccentric Victorian polymath; when he writes about topics close to his heart, he has the rare ability to weave emotion and objective scientific observation together; and he knows (or has known-time has thinned the ranks) practically everyone worth knowing, famous and obscure, rich and poor, artist and scientist, from New Mexico (where he lives physically) to Kazakhstan (where he lives spiritually).&#34; He still lives in Magdalena, a former cattle drive town in the mountains of southern New Mexico, with his wife, Elizabeth (Libby) Adam Frishman, a second-generation mountaineer, paleoarchaeologist, and former Outward Bound trekking guide.<p>"Steve Bodio brings his legendary Renaissance vision to this startling first novel, a work so mammoth in scope and elegant in execution it makes me wish he'd been writing fiction all along."</p><p> --Malcolm Brooks, Painted Horses</p><p> </p><p>..".a fell vision of rewilding, brought forth in writing that is nothing less than rewilded itself.

Part private residence, part goldfish bowl, and part national shrine, the White House is both the most important address in America and the most intensely scrutinized. In this splendid blend of the personal and historic, Margaret Truman offers an unforgettable tour of &#x201c;the president&#x2019;s house&#x201d; across the span of two centuries.<br><br>Opened (though not finished) in 1800 and originally dubbed a &#x201c;palace,&#x201d; the White House has been fascinating from day one. In Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s day, it was a reeking construction site where congressmen complained of the hazards of open rubbish pits. Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s supporters, descending twenty thousand strong from the backwoods of Kentucky and Tennessee, nearly destroyed the place during his first inaugural. Teddy Roosevelt expanded it, Jackie Kennedy and Pat Nixon redecorated it. Through all the vicissitudes of its history, the White House has transformed the characters, and often the fates, of its powerful occupants.<br><br>In <i>The President&#x2019;s House</i>, Margaret Truman takes us behind the scenes, into the deepest recesses and onto the airiest balconies, as she reveals what it feels like to live in the White House. Here are hilarious stories of Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s rambunctious children tossing spitballs at presidential portraits&#x2013;as well as a heartbreaking account of the tragedy that befell President Coolidge&#x2019;s young son, Calvin, Jr. Here, too, is the real story of the Lincoln Bedroom and the thrilling narrative of how first lady Dolley Madison rescued a priceless portrait of George Washington and a copy of the Declaration of Independence before British soldiers torched the White House in 1814. <br><br>Today the 132-room White House operates as an exotic combination of first-class hotel and fortress, with 1,600 dedicated workers, an annual budget over $1 billion, and a kitchen that can handle anything from an intimate dinner for four to a reception for 2,400. But ghosts of the past still walk its august corridors&#x2013;including a phantom whose visit President Harry S Truman described to his daughter in eerie detail.<br><br>From the basement swarming with reporters to the Situation Room crammed with sophisticated technology to the Oval Office where the president receives the world&#x2019;s leaders, the White House is a beehive of relentless activity, deal-making, intrigue, gossip, and of course history in the making. In this evocative and insightful book, Margaret Truman combines high-stakes drama with the unique perspective of an insider. The ultimate guided tour of the nation&#x2019;s most famous dwelling, <i>The President&#x2019;s House</i> is truly a national treasure.</p><p><b>Margaret Truman</b> has won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, including her ongoing series of Capital Crimes mysteries. Her previous bestselling biographies are <i>Harry S Truman</i>, <i>Bess W. Truman</i>, and <i>First Ladies</i>. She lives in Manhattan.<b><br>1<br><br>Magic and Mystery in a Unique Place</b><br>The last time I was in Washington, D.C., I walked by the White House on the way to dinner at a nearby restaurant. Hidden floodlights made the historic building glow like a mansion in a vision or a dream. Suddenly I thought: I am not the woman who lived in that house more than fifty years ago. She is a completely different person. I barely know her.<br><br>The words whispered in my mind like a voice from another world. I was remembering, or trying to remember, what it meant to be the daughter of the president of the United States, living in that shining shimmering house. The one inescapable thing I recalled was the difference. I have lived in several houses and apartments, and spent some time in splendid establishments, including a few royal palaces. But not one of them--or all of them together--can compare to the feeling I recalled from my White House days.<br><br>That was when I resolved to write this book about one of the most mysterious, terrifying, exalting, dangerous, fascinating houses in the world. It is a house that has changed people in amazing, unexpected ways. It is a house that has broken hearts and minds. It is a house that has made some people weep when they walked out the door for the last time--and others feel like escapees from a maximum security prison. Some marriages have been saved within those pristine white walls. Others have been irrevocably ruined.<br><br>Children have played marvelously clever games inside and outside this unique piece of architecture. Other children have twisted and turned in their death throes while their weeping parents, arguably the most powerful persons on the North American continent, clutched them in their impotent arms. In those same second-floor bedrooms, radiant brides have dressed in virginal white and descended to meet loving husbands as the world applauded.<br><br>Once, one of these brides married a president. I am speaking of Frances Folsom and Grover Cleveland. A century or so ago, when I was a twenty-something, I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Cleveland, who told me the reason she was married in the White House instead of in her family home: Nowhere else could she and the president have their privacy guaranteed.<br><br>The old house is, to put it mildly, a paradoxical place. People who think in straight lines have a very difficult time adjusting to it. And as history has shown again and again, many of them never do. Even so, I think everyone who has ever lived in the White House would agree that it's a special experience--a unique combination of history, tragedy, comedy, melodrama, and the ups and downs of ordinary living all under one roof.<br><b><br>II</b><br>Men bearing that unique title, president of the United States, the office my father called "the greatest in the history of the world," have paced the White House's darkened halls in periods of national crisis, gazing at portraits of their predecessors on the walls, seeking communion with their triumphs--or shuddering at their blunders. Women reached out to these men, trying to offer them guidance, or at the very least solace for their awesome burdens. My mother managed to play both roles in my father's presidency--a feat too many obtuse historians and biographers have failed to recognize.<br><br>In the basement and attic rooms are the memories of the hundreds of other people who lived a large part of their working lives in this unique house, and experienced its aura of power and history. Their stories belong in this book, too. Some, I regret to say, were slaves. But the house, paradoxical as always, gradually became a place where free African-Americans demonstrated their right to equality.<br><br>Maggie Rogers began working as a White House maid when William Howard Taft became president in 1909. Her daughter, Lillian Rogers Parks, was hired as a seamstress at the White House in 1929 and worked until the end of the Eisenhower administration in 1961. Growing up, Lillian once asked her mother if she would be happier (and better paid) at some millionaire's mansion elsewhere in the capital. Maggie Rogers scorned the idea. "Heavens no, child! Be it ever so elegant, there's no place like the White House. Why, I'm living history!" There was black pride and White House pride achieving a magical fusion.<br><br>Also worth commemorating are the efforts of the dedicated, courageous, amazingly patient men who have struggled to keep presidents and their families alive in the often malevolent glare of public criticism and spasms of national hatred. We know them now as members of the Secret Service. But their predecessors are equally memorable, standing guard at the White House's doors in suits that were a size too large for them--to conceal their pistols. Most people, including some of the presidents they guarded, were unaware of those hidden weapons.<br><br>There is a side to these protectors that few people know about, much less appreciate--the many acts of kindness and thoughtfulness they perform for presidents and first ladies. Perhaps the most touching story comes from the sad days of President Woodrow Wilson's decline. Felled by a stroke, he sank into near despair as Congress rejected his dream of world peace embodied in the League of Nations.<br><br>When the crippled president went for a ride in the afternoon, the Secret Service used to round up a small crowd of government employees and strolling tourists, who waited at the White House gate to cheer him when he returned. It was a pathetic illusion, but a testament to how much these men cared about the president.<br><b><br>III<br></b><br>Perhaps the most intriguing White House denizens are the men and women who have worked beside presidents as their spokespersons or confidential advisers. More than anyone, they often shared the reflected glow of White House power. Not all of them were able to deal with it rationally or responsibly, though the vast majority have managed it. For many of them, the experience was more than a little harrowing--and in a few cases, fatal.<br><br>I am thinking of one of my most heartbreaking White House memories--the death of my father's boyhood friend and press secretary, Charlie Ross. Charlie went through high school with Harry Truman and went on to become a top-ranked Washington, D.C., reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. When my father turned to him for help in 1945, Charlie gave up a comfortable salary and rational hours for the ordeal of a White House in which clocks and sensible schedules ceased to exist. Five exhausting years later, during the frantic early months of the Korean War, when newsmen besieged the White House twenty-four hours a day, Charlie Ross collapsed and died of a heart attack at his desk. A weeping Harry Truman said the country had lost a great public servant--and he had lost his best friend.<br><b><br>IV</b><br>That memory leads us to another cadre of White House inhabitants, although many presidents and their families might be reluctant to bestow that title on them: the men and women of the media. They, too, participate in the aura of the White House--to the point where they sometimes act as if they run the place. I had a vivid reminder of this mind-set when I came to the White House to talk with Hillary Clinton in 1994 about my book in progress, First Ladies.<br><br>A badly misinformed White House policeman told me to enter the mansion through the press briefing room in the West Wing. The minute I stepped through the doorway, a half dozen reporters surrounded me. Why was I there? To advise Hillary on how to improve her performance as First Lady? What did I think of Hillary's latest hairstyle? Should she hold more press conferences ^ la Eleanor Roosevelt, or fewer ^ la Bess Truman (who held none at all)? I smiled sweetly and said "No comment" to these attempts to get me to put my foot in my mouth.<br><br>My favorite White House media story comes from my friend President Gerald Ford. Gerry says he and veteran newswoman Helen Thomas were strolling on a street near the White House when he saw one of those old-fashioned scales that gave you your fortune and weight for a penny. Gerry read the little fortune card aloud: "You are a marvelous orator and leader of men. Your future in your chosen career could not be brighter."<br><br>Helen, looking over his shoulder, said: "It's got your weight wrong, too."<br><br>As the wife (now widow) of a newspaperman, I recognize the necessity for such irreverence. As the daughter of a president, I don't have to like it. But I am prepared to include it, somewhat ruefully, in the White House's story.<br><b><br>V</b><br>The White House is far more than the place where presidents and hundreds of staffers work and presidential families live. It is also the place where America's pride and dignity as a sovereign nation are displayed. At official dinners and receptions, when the president enters the room to the U.S. Marine Band's resounding "Hail to the Chief," people recognize not only a powerful man but the nation, the United States of America. The immense amount of time and effort that presidents and first ladies and the White House staff devote to entertaining visitors from around the country and the world is a fascinating and important story. It, too, is part of the White House aura.<br><br>What a roster these visitors constitute! They range from the king and queen of England, whose snobbish servants started an uncivil war with the White House staff, to Russian grand dukes and Japanese noblemen, from world renowned politicians such as Winston Churchill, who gave himself a mild heart attack trying to open his bedroom window, to Cherokee and Creek and Sioux Indian chiefs, who did war dances on the lawn. Marvelous musicians such as pianist Vladimir Horowitz, soprano Jessye Norman, and cellist Pablo Casals (who performed for the Theodore Roosevelts in 1901 and for the John F. Kennedys sixty years later) have filled presidential ears with beautiful music. Entertainers such as Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand have made the place sound, for a few hours, like Broadway. Thick-necked political bosses have more than once converted the president's second-floor study or the Oval Office in the West Wing into smoke-filled rooms, where political careers were empowered--or destroyed.<br><b><br>VI</b><br>Admission to the White House has never been restricted solely to the elite. From the earliest days, presidents recognized its symbolic importance as a place where they greeted anyone and everyone who wanted to come in the door. Some of these early receptions make picturesque reading. Several turned into mob scenes that threatened to ruin the rugs and wreck the furniture--and even made one or two chief executives fear for their lives.<br><br>Presidents and their staffs soon learned they had to set limits to White House access if they wanted to have time to conduct the nation's business. Doorkeepers and appointments secretaries began screening scheduled visitors. But the tradition of the White House as the people's house lived on--and is alive and well in contemporary Washington.<br><br>You used to be able to stroll by 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue any day you chose, rain or shine, and see a long line of tourists--part of the million and a half Americans who streamed through the first-floor public rooms each year. As a small d as well as a large D democrat, that statistic has always gladdened my heart. Visiting the White House in person is a little like meeting a celebrity face-to-face. You get impressions and feelings that a newspaper or TV show--or even this book--can't communicate. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and during the war with Iraq in the spring of 2003, tours were temporarily suspended because of concerns about security. Group tours, which have to be arranged in advance, were eventually reinstated. I hope it won't be too much longer before the tours for the general public will also be resumed.<br><b>VII</b><br>The idea that the White House is the people's house has caused fierce quarrels every time a president or first lady tried to change the building in any significant way. There are squadrons of unofficial custodians, and not a few official guardians, who mount the media ramparts to hurl vituperation at the hapless first couple. John Quincy Adams was pilloried for buying a billiard table. Millard Fillmore was attacked for putting in a bathtub.<br><br>Grace Coolidge caused an uproar when she tried to redecorate the family quarters with furniture in the style of the period in which the White House was built. Ironically, Jacqueline Kennedy did the same thing for the public rooms some thirty-eight years later and was wildly acclaimed for her efforts. When my father added a balcony to the South Portico, you would have sworn from the screams that impeachment was just around the corner.<br><br>Then there are the media and congressional snipers who are ready to open fire if they detect the slightest hint of snobbery or pretentiousness in the president's lifestyle. This has caused chief executives and first ladies no end of grief, and was largely responsible for depriving at least one president, Martin Van Buren, of a second term in the White House.<br><br>Van Buren had served as Andrew Jackson's vice president, which all by itself made him a ripe target for the Whigs (forerunners of the Republicans) who were against anyone or anything connected with Jackson. On top of that, Van Buren liked to live, dress, and entertain in style, which made it easy to cast him as a decadent aristocrat.<br><br>The opening salvo was fired at a dinner at the President's House when a Whig congressman picked up a gold spoon and announced that if he could show it to his constituents in Kentucky, they would rush to vote Van Buren out of office. The gold spoons, like most of the other furnishings, had been in the White House before Van Buren moved in, but that didn't stop another Whig congressman, Charles Ogle of Pennsylvania.<br><br>In the spring of 1840, a few months before Van Buren began his campaign for reelection, the House of Representatives was considering a bill to allot $3,665 for landscaping the grounds and repairing the furniture in the President's House. Ogle took advantage of the occasion to launch a passionate diatribe against Van Buren.<br><br>Taking his listeners on an imaginary tour of the "Presidential Palace," Ogle commented on its "regal splendor," which far exceeded "the grand saloons at Buckingham Palace. . . ." He condemned the president's bonbon stands and green glass finger bowls and assailed him for serving fancy French food instead of such old-fashioned favorites as "hog and hominy" or "fried meat and gravy."<br><br>Ogle's harangue went on for three days. In the midst of castigating Van Buren for living like a king at public expense, he managed to inject more than a few comments about the down-home virtues of the Whig presidential candidate, William Henry Harrison. The congressman's oration kicked off one of the most vitriolic campaigns in American history, and sent Martin Van Buren home to New York.</p><h2>The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century</h2><p>Most of what has been written on the medieval Balkans&#x2014;the area that now encompasses Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania&#x2014; has been little more than a footnote to Byzantine history or has been limited to narrow national histories. The Early Medieval Balkans is the first comprehensive examination of the events of early medieval Balkan history&#x2014;events that were as important as they are fascinating. The period that John Fine examines was an era of significant demographic, political, and religious change in the region. During this time, native populations were supplemented or replaced by the Bulgars and various Slavic tribes, who were to become the Bulgarians, Serbs, and Croats&#x2014;ethnic identities that exist to this day. They formed their first states and fought both militarily and politically, and with varying degrees of success, for protection from the domination of Constantinople and each other. Equally important, most of the people of the Balkans were converted to Christianity during this period and came under the religious jurisdiction of either Rome or Constantinople, thus determined which people would be Roman Catholic and which Eastern Orthodox at the time of the Great Schism. This polarity of religious loyalty has persisted into the twentieth century. This thorough and detailed study cuts through many of the myths and assumptions that have pervaded previous histories of the Balkans. It is an important source for those who wish to expand their knowledge of this turbulent period and who wish to broaden their understanding of the region.</p><p></p><h2>When The Chant Comes</h2><p>Kay Ulanday Barrett has been bringing his unique poetry to audiences for over a decade, unpicking vital political questions around race, sickness and disability and gender, and chronicling the everydayness of life in the U.S. Empire with humor, poignancy and inimitable vitality.

Yet few can name the work that helped win him the presidency: his published collection of speeches entitled <i>Political Debates Between Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas</i>. Lincoln labored in secret to get his book ready for the 1860 election, tracking down newspaper transcripts, editing them carefully for fairness, and hunting for a printer who would meet his specifications. <i>Political Debates</i> sold fifty thousand copies&#x2014;the rough equivalent of half a million books in today&#x2019;s market&#x2014;and it reveals something about Lincoln&#x2019;s presidential ambitions. But it also reveals something about his heart and mind. When voters asked about his beliefs, Lincoln liked to point them to his book.<br> <br>In Craig Fehrman&#x2019;s groundbreaking work of history, <i>Author in Chief</i>, the story of America&#x2019;s presidents and their books opens a rich new window into presidential biography<i>. </i>Beginning with Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, the first presidential book to influence a campaign, and John Adams&#x2019;s <i>Autobiography</i>, the first score-settling presidential memoir, <i>Author in Chief</i> draws on newly uncovered information&#x2014;including never-before-published letters from Andrew Jackson, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan&#x2014;to offer insights into the aspirations and inner lives of our nation&#x2019;s presidents. We see Teddy Roosevelt, known today for his rugged adventures and bulletproof self-confidence, as a vulnerable first-time author, struggling to write the book that would become a classic of American history. We see Ronald Reagan painstakingly revising <i>Where&#x2019;s the Rest of Me?</i>, a forgotten memoir in which he sharpened his sunny political image. We see Donald Trump negotiating the deal for <i>Art of the Deal</i>, the volume that made him synonymous with business savvy&#x2014;and decades later boosted him again on his way to the White House.<br> <br>Combining the narrative skill of a journalist with the rigorous scholarship of a historian, Fehrman presents hundreds of new stories, scenes, quotations, and telling details to create an entirely fresh take on our highest leaders. <i>Author in Chief </i>is a feast for history lovers, book lovers, and everybody curious about a behind-the-scenes look at our presidents.</p><p>Craig Fehrman&nbsp;is a journalist and historian who&#x2019;s written for <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post</i>,<i> The Wall Street Journal</i>,<i> The Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Slate</i>, among others.

By looking at presidents through the prism of their published writings, Fehrman throws new light on what John F.

In <i>Natural Grace</i>, Rupert Sheldrake and Matthew Fox show that not only is the synthesis of science and spirituality possible, but it is unavoidable when one considers the extraordinary insights they have both come upon in their work. Sheldrake, who has changed the face of modern science with his revolutionary theory of morphic resonance, and Fox, whose work in creation spirituality has had a significant impact on people's sense of spirit, balance each other with their unique yet highly complementary points of view. In these inspired dialogues a variety of ancient topics--including ritual, prayer, and the soul--are freed from the past and given new power for the future in the liberated universe Fox and Sheldrake show us.</p><p><p>Matthew Fox, a spiritual theologian and Episcopal priest, has authored twenty books that have brought the creation spirituality tradition to life, including <i>Original Blessing</i>. He is president of the newly formed University of Creation Spirituality in Oakland, California.</p><p>Rupert Sheldrake is one of the most innovative scientists of our time. He is a former Research Fellow of the Royal Society and was Director of Studies in biochemistry and cell biology at Clare College, Cambridge University, England. He is the author of several books, including <i>Seven Experiments That Could Change the World</i>. He lives in London.</p>A graceful and illuminating spiritual conversation between a well-known theologian and a cutting-edge scientist. Fox, an Episcopal priest and author of several books on spirituality (On Becoming a Musical, Mystical Bear, 1972, etc.), here engages in a unique conversation with Sheldrake (Seven Experiments That Could Change the World, 1995), a British scientist and former research fellow at Cambridge University. Their dialogue encompasses prayer, darkness, ecology, mysticism, and the soul; what emerges from their provocative insights is the sense that the gap between science and religion is perhaps not so wide as Western rationalism might have us believe. Both contend that Westerners have lost touch with their souls--that part of their being which links them to nature and the divine. Fox's contribution is somewhat more accessible than that of Sheldrake, who in criticizing the prevailing scientific worldview occasionally forgets that his readers may need that rationalist perspective explained before it can be thrown out of the window. Readers may also question ``morphic resonance,'' the controversial New Agetype theory that has made Sheldrake famous. He argues that through morphic resonance, ``if rats in Sheffield learn a new trick, rats all around the world should be able to learn it quicker just because it has been learned there.'' But the rest of the conversations are real gems. Both participants are lucid and creative in their approaches to hackneyed theological debates on worship, prayer, and meditation. Both share humbly and honestly from their personal experiences, often speaking anecdotally of the many remarkable people they have encountered in their careers. Fox also draws freely from the wisdom of past mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Theresa of Avila, and the effect is like magic. This is a book to be read under a shady tree when one has time to reflect and to enjoy the beauty of nature. (3 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A courageous leader, she used her wealth and connections to operate an underground railroad that saved hundreds of her fellow Spanish and Portuguese conversos (Jews who had been forced to convert to Catholicism) from the horrors of the Inquisition. Born in Lisbon in 1510, she later moved onto Antwerp, Venice, and Ferrara where she was constantly negotiating with kings and emperors for better conditions for her people. Do�a Gracia Nasi helped lead a boycott of the Italian port of Ancona in retaliation for the burning of 23 of her people by the Inquisition - an outrageous act in an era when Jews were more accustomed to appeasement. Finally settling in Constantinople, she persuaded Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent to grant her a long-term lease on the Tiberias region of Palestine, where she spearheaded one of the earliest attempts to start an independent state for Jews in Isr&#39;l. Do�a Gracia Nasi is equally important to history because she shatters the stereotype of how women, especially Jewish women, conducted their lives during the Renaissance period. Some historians have called her the most important Jewish woman since Biblical times.</p><p>*FINALIST FOR THE 2002-03 JEWISH BOOK AWARDAndrée Aelion Brooks is a journalist, author, and lecturer specializing in Jewish history topics.

He was trained in shiatsu and completed a two-year apprentice in shamanic healing. He went on to author more than 20 publications, a number of which have become standard works in their field and have been translated into 11 languages.<b>Part 3 <br> <br>Vital Body Massage <br> <br></b><i>In vital body massage we assume that each aspect of our being--every cell, all the tissues and organs, and our entire organism--has consciousness. Our body knows exactly what it needs and what does it good. The body has its own intelligence, which is energetic.</i> <br> <br><b>WHAT IS THE VITAL BODY?</b> <br> <br>The term <i>vital body</i> refers to the energetic, vibrational body that enlivens and gives essence to the physical body. Vital body massage, therefore, concentrates on the whole person on the energetic level rather than focusing solely on the physical, mechanical structure, and in this regard it is a true holistic therapy. Vital body massage that uses stones and crystals consists of very gentle touching of the skin with a chosen stone, with the intention of harmonizing and vitalizing the energy field that encircles and penetrates the physical body. This field is also frequently called the etheric body, the vital aura, the morphic field, and the subtle body. <br> <br>This energy field develops from the communication flow between our cells, tissues, and organs, as well as between our physical organism and our soul, mind, and spirit. Every cell in the body, taken on its own, is an autonomous creature with its own consciousness. Each cell controls its own breathing, metabolism, and regeneration. Just imagine if you had to constantly give orders to billions of cells; it is far better that they take care of these affairs themselves, isn&#x2019;t it? So, insofar as every cell has its own consciousness, it also has a desire to live; it has experiences, knows pain, and knows activity and relaxation. When several cells join together to form tissue, the same consciousness, basically, pertains to this larger entity; the same thing applies when tissues join to form an organ, and again in the fusion of organs to form an entire organism. <br> <br>This organization is only possible through communication: needs have to be expressed, orders transmitted, and procedures coordinated. The physical communication channels--nerves, blood, and lymph channels--are not sufficient for this load. That&#x2019;s why we also have energetic communication channels consisting of meridians and biophotons as well as telepathic networks consisting of synapses. <br> <br>The vital body is the sum of all energetic connections and communication processes in and around our body. The constant exchange via these connections is vital: it is what keeps the body alive. <br> <br><b>A VITAL BODY MASSAGE SEQUENCE</b> <br> <br>Crystals and gemstones in the form of wands, styluses, or tumbled stones are used in vital body massage. The wide end has a relaxing, calming effect, and the more pointed end is activating and vitalizing. Take the stone in your hand like a pencil, holding it between your thumb and middle finger and guiding it with your index finger. Ideally, the back of it will rest in the joint between thumb and index finger. If the stone is too short, it will take more effort to guide it. <br> <br>To begin, place the stylus on the skin very, very gently, and let it remain there for a moment. It is a minimal touch with no pressure whatsoever. In vital body massage we hover above the body making small circles with the stylus, grazing the skin with just a hint of a touch. <br>More precisely, the circles are actually small, spiraling movements. We wander over the body in this circling fashion, changing the direction of movement on impulse, choosing whichever direction feels easiest. <br> <br>Vital body massage is steered by the body&#x2019;s intelligence, so it is important to connect and empathize with the massage recipient--for instance by synchronizing your breathing. Periodically look at the face of the person you are working on for feedback as you proceed. As long as you are in tune with your client, you can rely on your intuition to guide your hand. <br> <br>The conventional sequence would begin with the client lying face down. Starting at the crown of the head, run down the neck, shoulders, back, buttocks, and legs (one after the other) to the soles of the feet and the tips of the toes, using circling movements of the stone. Then, with the client face up, change position and massage upward starting at the toes, then the feet, legs, pelvis/abdomen, and chest, then along the arms to the fingertips (one arm then the other). Then change your position and sit above the head of the person you are massaging. Massage from the shoulder along the neck and behind the ears up to the top of the skull (first one shoulder, Massage then the other) and from there over the forehead to the temples and ears, then from the base of the nose over the closed eyelids to the zygomatic bone and hinge of the jaw, and finally from the nose over the cheeks, around the mouth and over the chin. As a conclusion, lay the stylus on the person&#x2019;s third eye, the chakra point between the eyebrows, for 20 to 30 seconds. <br> <br><b>A COMPENDIUM OF MINERALS RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN VITAL BODY MASSAGE</b> <br> <br>The goal of this kind of energetic body massage is the harmonizing of the vital body. Improving energy flow and balance contributes to a more balanced life. Physically, improved vitality appears as more stable health. <br> <br>We can give this vitality additional direction (physically, intellectually, and spiritually) by adding specific healing stones to the massage. <br> <br><b>Calcite Calcite (orange)</b> imparts confidence and trust. Physically, calcite strengthens digestion, connective tissue, skin, and bones. <br> <br><b>Fire opal</b> vitalizes and makes one open-minded, cheerful, and fond of life. Physically, it boosts potency and fertility. <br> <br><b>Heliotrope</b> stimulates the immune system and is good to use at the beginning of illnesses, particularly to fight colds. <br> <br><b>Ruby kyanite</b> (a combination of ruby, blue kyanite, and fuchsite) eases pain and tension due to stress. It also encourages good sleep and gives a feeling of protection. Physically, it is very good for paralysis, rheumatism, infections, skin diseases, and heart and back disorders.</p><h2>Their Virgin Concubine: Masters of M�nage, Book 3</h2><p>The country of Bezakistan &#x2013; renowned for its wealth and the beauty of its deserts...

An imprint of his fist was clearly visible for a moment.</p> <p>"Best keep back, my dove. These Scots are foul-tempered creatures, to be sure. We've left civilization behind us in England." There was a note of longing in Maud's voice Clarrisa tried to ignore. She couldn't afford to be melancholy. Her uncle's word had been given, so she would be staying in Scotland, no matter her feelings on the matter.</p> <p>Better to avoid thinking about how she felt; better to try to believe her future would be bright.</p> <p>"The world is in a dark humor," Clarrisa muttered. Her companion lifted the gold cross hanging from her girdle chain and kissed it. "I fear we need a better plan than waiting for divine help, Maud."</p> <p>Maud's eyes widened. Faster than a flash, she reached over and tugged one of Clarrisa's long braids. Pain shot across her scalp before the older woman sent to chaperone her released her hair. "You'll mind your tongue, girl. Just because you're royal-blooded doesn't give you cause to be doubting that the good Lord has a hand in where you're heading. You're still bastard-born, so you'll keep to your place."</p> <p>Clarrisa moved to the other side of the wagon and peeked out again. She knew well who she was. No one ever let her forget, not for as long as she could recall. Still, even legitimate daughters were expected to be obedient, so she truly had no right to be discontented.</p> <p>So she would hope the future the horses were pulling her toward was a good one.</p> <p>The night was dark, thick clouds covering the moon's light. The trees looked sinister, and the wind sounded mournful as it rustled the branches. But Clarrisa didn't reach for the cross hanging from her own waist. No, she'd place her faith in her wits and refuse to be frightened. That much was within her power. It gave her a sense of balance and allowed her to smile. Yes, her future would hold good things, because she would be wise enough to keep her demeanor kind. A shrew never prospered.</p> <p>"Far past time for you to accept your lot with more humbleness," Maud mumbled, sounding almost as uninterested as Clarrisa felt. "You should be grateful for this opportunity to better your lot. Not many bastards are given such opportunities."</p> <p>Clarrisa didn't respond to Maud's reminder that she was illegitimate. There wasn't any point. Depending on who wore the crown of England, her lineage was a blessing or a curse.</p> <p>"If you give the Scottish king a son&#x2015;"</p> <p>"It will be bastard-born, since I have heard no offer of marriage," Clarrisa insisted.</p> <p>Maud made a low sound of disapproval and pointed an aged finger at her. "Royal-blooded babes do not have to suffer the same burdens the rest of us do. In spite of the lack of blessing from the church your mother suffered, you are on your way to a bright future. Besides, this is Scotland. He'll wed you quickly if you produce a male child. He simply doesn't have to marry you first, because you are illegitimate. Set your mind to giving him a son, and your future will be bright."</p> <p>Clarrisa doubted Maud's words. She lifted the edge of the wagon cover again and stared at the man nearest her. His plaid was belted around his waist, with a length of it pulled up and over his right shoulder. The fabric made a good cushion for the sword strapped to his wide back.</p> <p>Maybe he was a Scotsman, but the sword made him look like any other man she had ever known. They lived for fighting. Power was the only thing they craved. Her blood was nothing more than another way to secure what the king of Scotland hungered for.</p> <p>Blessing? Not for her, it wouldn't be.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lytge Sutherland was an earl, but he ruled like a prince on his land at the top of Scotland. Plenty of men envied him, but the wiser ones gave him deference gladly, because they knew his life was far from simple. At the moment he was feeling the weight of ten lairds, only half of whom he called friends.</p> <p>"If the rumor is true, we must act," Laird Matheson insisted. "With a York-blooded son, that bastard James will pass the crown on to an English puppet."</p> <p>"Or a king who the English will nae war with because they share common blood," Laird Morris argued.</p> <p>The room filled with angry shouts as men leaned over the tables in front of them to give their words more strength.</p> <p>"Enough!" Lytge snapped. There were several cutting glares, but Matheson and Morris both sat back in their chairs. The tension in the room was so tight the earl knew he had to find a solution before the men assembled before him began fighting one another. "Let us not forget how important it is for us to stand together, or James will get his wish to disinherit his first son, a young man worthy of our loyalty. If we squabble among one another, we will have to be content with James remaining king."</p> <p>Laird Matheson snarled, "That bastard has no' done what a king should. He gives riches to his favorites and refuses to punish thieving clans like the MacLeods! It's his fault we're fighting Highlander against Highlander."</p> <p>"Which is why we're all here, united against him despite half our own kin calling it treason." It was a younger man who spoke this time, and the earl grinned in spite of his desire to appear detached.</p> <p>"Young Laird MacNicols says it clearly. We're here because we're united&#x2015;a bond that needs to remain strong. The York lass must be eliminated before she can perform the function James desires of her. We do nae need England's war on our soil."</p> <p>"We'll have to find her first," Faolan Chisholms said. "Such will nae be a simple task."</p> <p>The old earl looked around the room. There was plenty of spirit in the lairds' eyes, but thinking the deed done would not gain them success. It would take cunning and strength, along with a healthy amount of arrogance for the man willing to try and steal from the king. Such a man would have to believe himself above failure. The earl was sitting in the right place to find him, for they were all Highlanders.</p> <p>"I'll find her and steal her." Broen MacNicols spoke quietly&#x2015;too quietly for the earl's comfort.</p> <p>"Ye've got vengeance in yer eyes, young MacNicols. Understandable, since James has slighted yer patience by refusing ye justice concerning the death of yer father."</p> <p>The earl's son, Norris, slammed a fist into the table, sending several of the goblets wobbling. "James neglects us and leaves good men no choice but to feud when their neighbors commit crimes, since he will not dispense judgment upon the guilty."</p> <p>"I tried to respect the king instead of falling back on old ways," Broen snarled. "I took the matter of me father's murder at the hands of the Grants to the king. The man would nae even see me, much less send an envoy to Donnach Grant to demand me betrothed be returned." He flattened his hands on the tabletop, leaning over it. "I made a choice, sure enough, for I'm here, and I tell ye I will make sure the king does nae get the lass he wants while he refuses me justice for the murder of the woman I was contracted to. She died on Grant land, and I deserved more than a letter telling me she's dead."</p> <p>Lytge Sutherland nodded and heard several of the other lairds slap the tabletop in agreement. "We place our faith in ye, Laird MacNicols. Find the York bastard, and ye'll have me at yer back when ye demand that explanation from Donnach Grant."</p> <p>There was a solid ring of endorsement in the earl's tone. Broen didn't enjoy it. His father had been dead for four months, but he still felt the sting of the loss like a fresh wound. He reached up and tugged on the corner of his bonnet before quitting the chamber.</p> <p>"Ye're in a hurry." Broen didn't lessen his pace as Faolan Chisholms caught up with him. They'd been young boys together, and now fate had made them lairds in nearly the same season.</p> <p>"There is no reason to sit at a table drinking and talking like old men. I've an Englishwoman to find, since that is the only way I'll possibly see an explanation to me father's death that will nae require spilling blood when the snow melts."</p> <p>"Aye, Sutherland will nae be giving ye his assistance otherwise, but ye need to know where to look for her before ye ride out," Faolan insisted.</p> <p>Broen stopped and faced Faolan. "If ye want to come along, ye should have stood up when the earl was looking for men to take on the burden."</p> <p>Faolan grunted. "Ye did nae give me a chance."</p> <p>Broen shrugged, gaining a narrow look from Faolan. His friend muttered, "The betrothal was nae complete, and ye know it, Broen. Me own father was set on gaining Daphne for me. The match with her was a fine one, and we all knew it. Her dowry was nae yers just yet, nor was the alliance with her clan. I wanted her too."</p> <p>"It was me father who died on Grant land after that bastard Donnach Grant wrote and told us Daphne was dead. He will nae answer me letters or allow me onto his land to gain more details. Me men are demanding justice, which means a bloody summer when we begin feuding with them," Broen snarled. "So, as it stands, I have more to lose than ye."</p> <p>"I know it well. We should combine our clans and wipe Donnach Grant off the face of the Highlands, since the king will nae do his duty and give us justice."</p> <p>Broen laughed, low and unpleasant. "I'll be paying James back for that slight. Ye noticed I was in a hurry, and it's the truth I am. A king who will nae keep us united is one I refuse to be loyal to, so I'm off to ensure his son inherits as he should. Besides, if stealing one woman can possibly ensure I can gain an explanation from Donnach Grant that will keep me men from spilling blood, I'll steal her."</p> <p>The words came easier than Broen had thought they would. Surprise appeared on Faolan's face. Broen turned and continued on toward the doors of the tower before he thought too deeply about why he'd chosen service to the earl over securing vengeance for Daphne himself. He shouldn't need any further details to honor his men's wishes for retribution.</p> <p>But that was the old way of thinking. Unity had its merits, and a good future would only come if the clans stood together. He needed to think beyond his own lust for vengeance and consider the innocents who would die if he was feuding with his neighbors. A mature man recognized that he risked more than his own blood; only lads rushed off with their own glory on their minds.</p> <p>The afternoon shadows were growing longer, but that didn't stop him from gesturing for his horse. James III was a disaster of a king. Half the Highland clans were feuding because he'd failed to find time to settle disputes, which left the Highlanders to take up ancient ways. The Lowlands were faring little better. The country was splitting in half. James had gone too far in his quest to gain a York-blooded son, though. That rumor was the foulest of all, because it would bring the English war into Scotland.</p> <p>Not while he drew breath.</p> <p>The royalists would brand him a traitor, but he'd wear the title proudly. James had a son, one who'd been raised by his mother and would rule well. The lad was grown now, but the queen had died, which cleared the way for James to wed again. The greedy man wanted to annul his marriage to a dead woman and gain himself a York-blooded wife, which would bind Scotland to the bloody English.</p> <p>It was too much. Too much for Broen to accept from a sovereign he was supposed to kneel in front of and offer his loyalty to. Maybe in France a weakling could wear the crown, but Broen was a Highlander and he'd never kneel in front of a king who wouldn't keep his country united. Or any Scot who would buy himself a bastard daughter of the late king of England. The rumors claimed James had paid dearly for one of the few bastards acknowledged by Edward IV, who had enjoyed having mistresses in spite of claiming to love Elizabeth Woodville. Broen grinned. There was justice for a man&#x2015;Edward had married a woman famed to be the most beautiful girl in England, but she hadn't been royal-blooded and half his nobles had turned on him.</p> <p>Well, James III of Scotland may have paid for a York lass, but Broen planned to steal her. He was a Highlander, after all. James would be a fool not to expect it. If the king had taken precautions, the effort might cost Broen his life. He'd take the chance. Life wasn't worth living as a coward too busy sniveling about the wrongs done to his clan to take action. Besides, it was his opportunity to gain Sutherland's backing to put an end to the vengeance being demanded by his clan. There were some who would call him a coward for trying to avoid a feud, but he rather liked knowing he wasn't such a savage as to overlook a possible solution that didn't involve bloodshed. It didn't make him less of a Highlander, only more of a laird, because he had to think of his entire clan before allowing his personal feelings to be satisfied.</p> <p>Yes, he'd do what he'd promised&#x2015;or die trying.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Where is she?"</p> <p>Clarrisa faced the door as Maud began muttering prayers. The tower was rough, and the rushes on the floor smelled foul. She stared at the rushes. They confirmed she had left civilization behind her in England, where most homes no longer used such, because by winter's end, they were filthy. But the walls were made of stone, and the men who had met her at the border were set to watch the doorway, leaving her nothing to do but face whoever came for her.</p> <p>She had no reason to be surprised to discover she'd been shipped to Scotland in the middle of the night. Her entire life had been one of being told that her duty was to her family. The war between the York and Lancaster nobles had claimed so many lives among the blue-blooded. No child&#x2015;even one bastard-born such as herself&#x2015;was overlooked. Blue blood was noble, and controlling it the key to which family would claim the crown.</p> <p>So Clarrisa stared at the door, waiting to see whom her uncle had sent her to. The sound of heavy footfalls came from outside the door, along with soft whines. The wooden door burst inward, its hinges squealing.</p> <p>"Hiding, are ye? I expected as much from an English bitch." James III stopped just inside the doorway, a couple of hunting hounds at his heels. One lifted its leg and wet the door frame, telling her exactly where the stench in the room had come from. Man and beasts lived together in the keep, and the idea made her skin crawl.</p> <p>"I was told to wait for you here." She didn't add any title, for the moment felt informal. It bothered her to know she was being sent to him so secretly, so he might do as he pleased without any protest from the church. "Which is what I am doing. It is not hiding."</p> <p>She tried to temper her tone, but his eyes narrowed before he stepped closer with one fist raised. "Ye'll mind yer tongue with me, woman, else I'll teach ye the manners yer York kin failed to. No woman argues with me. I answer only to God. Why do ye think yer country's nobles are at one another's throats? They crave the same privilege."</p> <p>Clarrisa lowered herself, remaining down while he grunted with approval. Oh yes, the king of Scotlan...</p></p><h2>Gardener&#39;s Latin: A Lexicon</h2><p>For more than a decade, gardeners have been turning to a beautiful little hardcover book called Gardener's Latin, by Bill Neal.

The titular story revolves around an aging English professor who, mourning the loss of his wife, robs other people's homes of their sentimental knick-knacks. In "Free Ham," a young dropout wins a ham after her house burns down and refuses to accept it. &#x201c;Has my ham done anything wrong?&#x201d; she asks when the grocery store manager demands that she claim it. &nbsp;In "Carry Me Home, Sisters of Saint Joseph," a failed commercial writer moves into the basement of a convent and inadvertently discovers the secrets of the Sisters of Saint Joseph.

In &#x201c;The Idea of Marcel,&#x201d; Emily, a conservative, elegant girl, has dinner with the idea of her ex-boyfriend, Marcel. In a night filled with baffling coincidences, including Marcel having dinner with his idea of Emily, she wonders why we tend to be more in love with ideas than with reality. In and out of the rooms of these gritty, whimsical stories roam troubled, funny people struggling to reconcile their circumstances to some kind of American Ideal and failing, over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories of <i>Safe as Houses</i> are magical and original and help answer such universal and existential questions as: How far will we go to stay loyal to our friends? Can we love a man even though he is inches shorter than our ideal? Why doesn&#x2019;t Bob Dylan ever have his own smokes?

As Dr. Wolf sets about deciding which of her patients, if either, is the real Lucan, she finds herself in a fierce battle of wills and an exciting chase across Europe. For someone is deceiving someone, and it may be the good doctor, who, despite her unorthodox therapeutic method (she talks mainly about her own life), has a sinister past, too.<br>Exhibiting Muriel Spark&#x2019;s boundless imagination and biting wit, <b>Aiding and Abetting</b><i> </i>is a brisk, clever, and deliciously entertaining tale by one of Britain&#x2019;s greatest living novelists.</p><p>First, a bit of history: The seventh Earl of Lucan disappeared on November 7, 1974, leaving behind the battered body of his children's nanny and a beaten wife. Widely covered in the press, his sensational story has had a surprisingly long half-life, and the speculation about his whereabouts has never quite died out. In this book, Muriel Spark toys with several provocative issues arising out of the case: identity, class, blood ("it is not purifying, it is sticky"), and the dynamics of psychiatry ("most of the money wasted on psychoanalysis goes on time spent unraveling the lies of the patient").<p> <i>Aiding and Abetting</i> opens sometime late in the 20th century, when an Englishman in his 60s walks into the Paris practice of famed Bavarian psychiatrist Dr Hildegard Wolf and announces that he is the missing Lord Lucan. Yet Hildegrad is already treating one self-confessed Lord Lucan. And what's more, both patients seem to have dirt on her--for isn't she really Beate Pappenheim, a notorious fraud who used her menstrual blood to fake her stigmata? Fearing for her safety, Hildegard flees to London, where her path inevitably crosses that of two British Lucan hunters.</p><p> <i>Aiding and Abetting</i> contains more than its share of broad farce and bitter irony. But it remains a strange, slight affair, its unspoken tenet being that the Lucan case still preys on the communal mind of the British public, its details (like the perpetrator's penchant for smoked salmon and lamb chops) indelibly printed there. For anyone under 30, that's a difficult argument to swallow. As one wise character puts it: "Few people today would take Lucan and his pretensions seriously, as they rather tended to do in the 70s." Times have changed indeed--and perhaps that's Spark's point after all, that the "psychological paralysis" of the not-quite-swinging '70s is long gone. <i>--Alan Stewart</i></p>&#x201c;Elegant and chilling. . . .

There's more to it than just a detective, a dead body, and Colonel Mustard in the drawing room with the candlestick. Fortunately, Larry Beinhart--Edgar Award-winning author of You Get What You Pay For, Foreign Exchange, and American Hero--has taken a break from writing smart, suspenseful thrillers to act as your guide through all the twists and turns of creating the twists and turns of a good mystery. <br>Drawing on advice and examples from a host of the best names in mystery writing--from Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane to Scott Turow and Thomas Harris--plus some of his own prime plots, Larry Beinhart introduces you to your most indispensable partners in crime: <br> *Character, plot, and procedure <br> * The secrets to creating heroes, heroines, and villains ("All writers draw upon themselves and their experience. While the whole of yourself might not be capable of being either a serial killer or an FBI agent, there are parts in each of us that are capable of almost anything.")<br> * The fine art of scripting the sex scene<br> *The low-down on violence ("A crime novel without violence is like smoking pot without inhaling, sex without orgasm, or a hug without a squeeze." )<br> *And much more!<br>From the opening hook to the final denouement, Larry Beinhart takes the mystery out of being a mystery writer.</p><p><b>Larry Beinhart</b> is the Edgar Award-winning author of&nbsp;<i>No One Rides for Free, How to Write a Mystery</i>,<i> You Get What You Pay For</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Foreign Exchange.</i>&nbsp;His book <i>American Hero</i>&nbsp;was adapted into the movie <i>Wag the Dog</i>.INTRODUCTION<br> The Joy of Genre<br> &nbsp;<br> Genre is a gaudy, tawdry Muse, but the favors she brings the writer are gifts of genuine gold.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first and most important gift is&#x2014;an Audience. It is from them that all the other gifts flow.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like news, or for that matter, pornography, the audience is insatiable. Who could imagine that there could be more news programming? But there is. Or more skin magazines? But there are. Why are all those books in the mystery section and how come there are new ones every week? There are people who read a mystery a week, a day, or more. Personally, I never get on a plane, a train, a bus, or a subway without one.<br> &nbsp;<br> That means that there is a Market.<br> &nbsp;<br> Publishers need product, and quite a lot of it, to fill that market. If you can produce the material, almost regardless of quality&#x2014;it does not have to be the great American novel&#x2014;you can sell it.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is a wonderful thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> HOPE FOR THE WRITER<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s really intimidating to sit down at the keyboard with aspirations of being Hemingway or Shakespeare. When I think about someone doing that, his head full of Literature 101 Dreams of Immortality, I get a cartoon vision of a floor littered with wads of crushed first pages&#x2014;hundreds and hundreds of them, decades of litter, not one page one good enough to be the first page of a novel by the new James Joyce.<br> &nbsp;<br> The average detective novel is probably no worse than the average novel, but you never see the average novel. It doesn&#x2019;t get published. The average&#x2014;or only slightly above average&#x2014;detective story does. Not only is it published but it is sold&nbsp;...&nbsp;and it is read....<br> &nbsp;<br> Raymond Chandler, The Simple Art of Murder<br> &nbsp;<br> The event that inspired me to become a working writer was reading two truly dreadful mysteries in one day. There and then I was convinced that if I wrote one, no matter how bad it was, I could sell it.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t that I thought that I could do better. What was exciting, thrilling, illuminating, was that someone had published these meandering, illogical, poorly constructed, clich�-ridden manuscripts and&#x2014;I presumed&#x2014;actually paid the writers! This was attainable.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I tell this story I am always asked: Which two books were they? I honestly don&#x2019;t remember. But I have certainly read many since then that are just as bad or worse. If someone else feels a book inside them, but needs the same sort of perverse incitement to write it, there are lots of terrible books out there. In any case, that gave me the courage and the self-confidence to write a first page, keep it, get past it, write a second page, and on and on, until there was a complete manuscript. Which I duly brought to an agent who sold it to a publisher who printed it and put it in bookstores which sold it. To people rather like me.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is not meant to imply, in any way, that I, or other authors, do less than their best, or that they write down, or that it&#x2019;s easy. Like the other authors I know, I always try to write the best book I can. At times it&#x2019;s very difficult. It is meant to say that the goal is in reach. If you can write a clear sentence, if you can organize your thoughts, if you know the field and love it, and if you will make the commitment, you can probably write a salable book.<br> &nbsp;<br> WHAT IS GENRE?<br> &nbsp;<br> The simplest, most effective, and laziest definition is that it&#x2019;s whatever gets you placed on the mystery rack rather than with general fiction.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, there are those novels that escape the ghetto and move over to the main shelves and even to the &#x201c;hot&#x201d; book table at the front of the store, that don&#x2019;t seem any different than the ones in the crime section. Actually, at any given time, a minimum of half the books on the bestseller lists are mysteries or detective novels or thrillers or legal thrillers. For their sake, let us throw in a second simple definition: they are books that have, as their center, the commission of a crime or the discovery of who committed a crime.<br> &nbsp;<br> AND WHY THERE IS A MARKET<br> &nbsp;<br> The basic story of the mystery genre is &#x201c;whodunit.&#x201d; There are, of course, endless variations, alterations, and decorations, howdunit, whydunit, whatcha gonna do about it, but &#x201c;whodunit&#x201d; is the essence.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is a matter of human nature that once a question is raised, people want the matter settled. In other words, if you kill someone on page one and pose the question &#x201c;whodunit?&#x201d; a fair number of people will stay with you long enough to find out the answer.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we liken a book to a train, the &#x201c;puzzle&#x201d; is the engine. A nongenre writer has to invent an engine&#x2014;create a question that people will want answered&#x2014;and then convince a potential audience that it is a train, that it will take them on the sort of journey they like, and they therefore ought to give it a try. The genre writer gets this for free: the audience knows it&#x2019;s a train, that it has an engine that will make it go, and that it is, more or less, the sort of journey they like.<br> &nbsp;<br> Opening with a riddle frees the author from the frequently demanding task of drawing his readers into the narrative by other means.... Knowing that a book is a thriller guarantees a plot: it promises an element of entertainment so often lacking in the &#x201c;serious&#x201d; novel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Piers Paul Read, the Times, September 16, 1995<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a train. People get on. The qualitative questions come afterward: Did you give them a good ride? How was the scenery and how were the companions?<br> &nbsp;<br> The answer to the first&#x2014;did you roar on through? keep on chugging? run out of steam? jump off the tracks?&#x2014;separates the successful from the unsuccessful.<br> &nbsp;<br> The answers to the last two&#x2014;how vivid were the views? did your riders-readers make new friends? or did they have to endure shallow bores mouthing the old clich�s they&#x2019;d heard on previous journeys? was the dialogue lively and picaresque?&#x2014;those are the things that separate the truly good from the merely mechanical.<br> &nbsp;<br> When it&#x2019;s a really good railroad, the passengers don&#x2019;t care where the train goes. Most readers of Ian Fleming and John Le Carr� have no independent interest in real-life espionage. Most readers of Dick Francis have no interest in horse racing, and even less in the esoteric variant which most of his books are about&#x2014;steeple chasing.<br> &nbsp;<br> So as long as you kill somebody in chapter one and tell &#x2019;em whodunit at the end, you get to pick the territory. In other words, your job is to explore and write about things that interest you until you get bored with them, and then you can find something new to work into a crime story. Tony Hillerman is obviously fascinated with Native American life and lore. In Daughter of Time it is absolutely clear that Josephine Tey was delighted by the deceptions of history. James Ellroy&#x2019;s mother was murdered when he was young. The police didn&#x2019;t solve the mystery. Ellroy, obsessed by it, found the time and the money to investigate it thirty years after the event, by turning it into a book proposal. Robert Parker likes to cook and he likes clothes, and these interests fill up a lot of the Spenser books. Eric Ambler filled his books with the politics of Mediterranean, Near Eastern, and Eastern European countries. Gerald Seymour, like a war reporter, goes wherever people are killing each other in the name of God and country. There are books set in suburban dental offices, on boats at sea, in late-twentieth-century Cleveland, in alternate realities in which Hitler won World War II, and in a future in which the uneasy buddy relationship is between a human cop from earth and an android cop from the outer worlds. I like to ski, so I set a novel in the Austrian resort of St. Anton and had to spend six solid weeks skiing there to research it.<br> &nbsp;<br> A lot of readers want an informative, fact-filled tour. Infotainment. Recreation that is actually education. Who can feel that they&#x2019;re wasting their time with a trashy detective novel while tracking the medieval arcana of Umberto Eco&#x2019;s The Name of the Rose?<br> &nbsp;<br> Herbert Mitgang, who writes about all types of literature, not merely mysteries, for the New York Times, put it this way in a review of two books, Walter Mosley&#x2019;s White Butterfly and Gillian Farrell&#x2019;s Alibi for an Actress:<br> &nbsp;<br> While taking the reader for a ride before solving the mystery, the best writers in the field have something to say about a city, a profession, a just cause, a moral climate. Of course, the detective story must abide by the rules of pursuit and solution. But it doesn&#x2019;t violate the formula if, lurking between the lines, there&#x2019;s a novel of manners, mostly bad.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the article quoted earlier, Piers Paul Read, a serious writer, was actually being defensive about writing a thriller. This was in England, where they are actually still quite serious about the distinction between real writers and popular writers. Using the genre conventions, he went on to say:<br> &nbsp;<br> ...The reader, comfortably seated, is happy to enjoy the landscape as the story hurtles along.... [The author] can treat his loftier themes in passing: in this case&nbsp;...&nbsp;history, iconography, patriotism, consumerism, communism, feminism and love. [There, are these serious and correct enough for you?!]<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Cartesian Sonata and Other Novellas</h2><p>From the award-winning author of The Tunnel and A Temple of Texts come four interrelated novellas that explore good and evil, action and thought, redemption and possession. The reader will encounter here a traveling salesman who gets lost in the kitschy clutter of a small town in Illinois, a young woman in rural Iowa who loses touch with the outside world and turns to the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop as anchor, and the coming-of-age story of a devilish young man named Luther (who might as well be called Lucifer). These stories are filled with the familiar style, brilliance, philosophy, and wit that fans of William Gass have come to expect and cherish.</p><p>Reading William H. Gass's fiction is a little like looking at oneself in a fractured mirror: the usual components are all there, but not necessarily in the right places. Take, for example, the title novella of <i>Cartesian Sonata and Other Novellas</i>: here Gass introduces us to Ella Bend, a sensitive clairvoyant married to a rather burdensome husband. But no sooner does Gass get us started with a very conventional opening, ("This is the story of Ella Bend Hess, of how she became clairvoyant and what she was able to see") than he injects himself into it ("Her gift was the gift of the gods ... inexplicable and merciless. Marvelous is what I mean. Miraculous. Mysterious? Surely not a word so weak. Yet it has to begin with an <i>m</i>"). It isn't long before Ella becomes a bit player in her own story, the starring role having been appropriated by artful digressions, dizzying streams of consciousness, and Gass's own formidable wordsmithing talents.<p> The other three novellas in this collection are equally high-concept: a traveling salesman falls in love with his hotel room and refuses to leave; an aging spinster literally loses herself in a line from an Elizabeth Bishop poem; a young boy inexplicably decides to live for revenge. The plots, such as they are, are offbeat enough to catch the interest--what holds it, however, is Gass at play in the fields of the word. <i>Cartesian Sonata</i> will not be to every reader's taste--those who are impatient with absurdity, non sequiturs, and pages and pages of verbal pyrotechnics may want to steer toward more conventional literature. Those who like their fiction liberally laced with equal measures of philosophy and anarchy, however, should give William H. Gass a try.</p>rd-winning author of The Tunnel and Finding a Form--four interrelated novellas that explore Mind, Matter, and God. In the first novella, Gass redefines Descartes&#39; philosophy. God is a writer in a constant state of fumble. Mind is represented by a housewife who is a modern-day Cassandra. And Matter is, what (and who) else but the helpless and confused husband of Mind. In the novella that follows, the concept of salvation is explored through material possessions--a collection of kitsch--as a traveling businessman is slowly lost in the sheer surfeit of matter in a small Illinois town. In another, Gass explores the mind&#39;s ability to escape. A young woman growing up in ruralIowa finds herself losing touch with the physical world as she loses herself in the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop. And in &#34;The Master of Secret Revenges,&#34; God appears in the form of Descartes&#39; evil demon, Lucifer, as Gass chronicles the life of a young man named Luther and his development from his devilish youth to his demonic ad</p><h2>Bisbee (AZ) (Images of America)</h2><p>In the early 1900s, it was the largest city between St. Louis and San Francisco, bustling with the raw material of Wild West legends. Bisbee&#x2019;s infamous Brewery Gulch once supported 47 saloons and was considered the &#x201c;liveliest spot between El Paso and San Francisco.&#x201d; By the 1970s, opportunists had relieved Bisbee&#x2019;s Mule Mountains of billions of pounds of copper, 102 million ounces of silver, 2.8 million ounces of gold, and millions of pounds of zinc, lead, and manganese. The ore reserves were depleted, and when the last pickaxe struck plain old dirt, a mass exodus of miners collapsed the real estate market. But the lure of cheap land was a magnet for retirees, hippies, and artists. Boarding houses were converted into charming bed and breakfasts. Antique stores, galleries, cafes, and restaurants replaced the saloons. These days, a vibrant and eclectic community of ranchers, politicians, and free spirits; a well-preserved architectural and historic heritage; and &#x201c;the most perfect year-round climate&#x201d; make Bisbee, the county seat, a one-of-a-kind gem.</p><p>In this engaging retrospective, showcasing more than 200 archival photographs from private collections and the Bisbee Mining &amp; Historical Museum Society, author Ethel Jackson Price sifts through the rich history of the boomtown that simply refused to go bust.</p><h2>Saving Shiloh (The Shiloh Quartet)</h2><p>Marty Preston wonders why it is that despite Judd Traver's attempts to redeem himself everyone is still so willing to think the worst of him. Marty's friend David is sure that Judd will be named as the murderer of a man who has been missing. Others are sure that Judd is behind a series of burglaries in the area. But Marty's parents and, with some trepidation, Marty himself persist in their attempts to be good neighbors and to give Judd a second chance. Now that Marty has Shiloh, maybe he can help Judd to take better care of his other dogs. Then again, maybe folks are right -- there's no way a Judd Travers can ever change for the good. Then a terrifying life-or-death situation brings this dilemma into sharp focus. <i>Saving Shiloh</i> is a powerful novel that brings this trilogy to a close.</p><p>In <i>Saving Shiloh,</i> Phyllis Reynolds Naylor brings to a conclusion the trilogy begun with the Newbery Medal winner <i>Shiloh</i> and its sequel, <i>Shiloh Season.</i> Judd Travers is physically on the mend from the truck accident that nearly took his life in <i>Shiloh Season.</i> But is he healing inside too? Can Marty and his family and the community trust that Judd will not return to his evil ways? Marty's parents tell him that every person deserves a second chance. Most people in the surrounding community, however, are quick to assume the opposite and find ways to place Judd at the center of any trouble--even murder.<br><br>And then there's Marty, stuck right in the middle, wanting to believe in Judd, but afraid of anything that might place himself or his beloved dog, Shiloh, in jeopardy. Are his efforts to help Judd--and Judd's remaining dogs--worthwhile, or is Marty's friend David Howard right in seeing mounting evidence of the real trouble Judd is in? Finally something unexpected happens that puts Judd to the test--Judd and Shiloh, Marty and his sisters, the whole community, in fact.Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has written more than 135 books, including the Newbery Award&#x2013;winning&nbsp;<i>Shiloh&nbsp;</i>and its sequels, the Alice series,&nbsp;<i>Roxie and the Hooligans</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Roxie and the Hooligans at Buzzard&#x2019;s Roost</i>.

Readers will find in <i>Carrying Them with Us</i> comfort and wisdom, a spiritual perspective, and practical guidance.</p><p>The authors also invite into this journey the caregivers--family, clergy and medical professionals, and friends--who accompany grieving parents.</p><p>The book is organized around five questions the authors have found central to many parents' unfolding story: (1) How can this have happened? (2) Why do I feel like this? (3) How do I keep going? (4) What do I make of life after this? And (5) Who am I becoming?</p><p>Engelstad and Malotky show readers a path from devastating sadness toward healing, a way for grieving parents to keep going and, one day, to embrace new life.</p></p><p><p><b>David Engelstad</b>, an ELCA pastor, has dedicated twenty-four years of his ministry to long-term care and hospital chaplaincy. He has started and led support groups for pregnancy and newborn loss, Alzheimer's caregivers, multiple sclerosis patients, and grief/loss survivors.</p><p><b>Catherine Malotky</b>, an ELCA pastor, has served the church for over thirty years as a teacher, parish pastor, writer, editor, and coach. She is a frequent retreat leader, teacher, and preacher around the upper Midwest and for two decades has authored the Amen column in the ELCA's Gather magazine.</p><p>"Of all the books I have read in three decades as a grief therapist, this book by Catherine Malotky and David Engelstad stands out as one of the most compassionate, nonjudgmental, and heartfelt of all. The authors, bereaved from the death of their two-month-old daughter Erin, draw upon their own pain, doubts, and vulnerabilities to offer readers a resource that speaks both to the heart and to the head. The gentle suggestions they make for how to cope and how to help others are varied and practical. The authors will move you from the early pain of a loss to a consideration of how you might grow through the experience. This book is not limited to pregnancy and infant loss. I found the wise words of these seasoned pastors comforting in the loss of my spouse and my adult daughter. I would highly recommend this book to you." --Janice Winchester Nadeau, Ph.D., Licensed Psychologist, Marriage and Family Therapist and Nurse</p> <p>"<em>Carrying Them with Us</em> is a gentle, compassionate message of love, faith, and hope.

The reason: A certain well-connected wine connoisseur wants to make sure that this year's vintage goes to harvest. <br><br>In the hill town of Alba, Zen finds himself in the midst of a traditional culture in which family and soil are inextricablt linked, bombarded with gossip, and stalked by a mysterious telephone caller with tantalizing clues to his past. He also discovers that certain meals may really be to die for. <b>A Long Finish</b> is Michael Dibdin at his most elegant and surprising.</p><p>Fresh from the successful investigation of a series of crimes in Naples, that admirably devious and dour Italian police inspector Aurelio Zen returns to his office in Rome to discover that a new set of bureaucrats is in power--with plans to punish him for his success by sending to him Sicily to fight the Mafia. Fate, in the form of a powerful film director, offers a way out: Zen is to go instead to Piedmont, where the murder of a noted winemaker--apparently by his son and heir--threatens the future of one of the film director's favorite vintages. Even though Zen is a Venetian by birth and drinks "fruity, fresh <i>vino sfuso</i> from the Friuli intended to be consumed within the year" as the director sarcastically notes, he can still see how important the case can be to his future--especially if it keeps him away from deadly Sicily. Not only wine but also truffles are involved in a growing series of murders in the area around Alba, and Michael Dibdin (an English writer who lives in Seattle but must spend lots of time in Italy) once again manages to capture the heart, soul, and stomach of the region. Zen, whose personal life is gradually revealed and expanded in each book in the series, finds out several surprising things about being a father in this one.

Although <i>Culture Matters</i> offers varying responses to this politically incorrect question, its editors, Lawrence E. Harrison and Samuel P. Huntington, as well as the bulk of its contributors, answer in some form of the affirmative. In an introduction, Harrison (author of <i>Underdevelopment Is a State of Mind</i>) writes in the third person of the movement he helps lead: "They are the intellectual heirs of Alexis de Tocqueville, who concluded that what made the American political system work was a culture congenial to democracy; Max Weber, who explained the rise of capitalism as essentially a cultural phenomenon rooted in religion; and Edward Banfield, who illuminated the cultural roots of poverty and authoritarianism in southern Italy, a case with universal applications." (The book, moreover, is dedicated to Banfield, "who has illuminated the path for so many of us.") For readers loath to make value judgments about cultures, <i>Culture Matters</i> may be tough going. But admirers of <i>Trust</i> by Francis Fukuyama, <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i> by David Landes, and any number of books by Thomas Sowell will find much to admire on these pages. Fukuyama and Landes, in fact, have written chapters--along with Barbara Crossette, Robert Edgerton, Nathan Glazer, Seymour Martin Lipset, Orlando Patterson, Lucian Pye, Jeffrey Sachs, and many others. In an especially compelling essay on Africa's continuing plight, Daniel Etounga-Manguelle asks, "What cultural reorientation is necessary so that in the concert of nations we [Africans] are no longer playing out of tune?" <p> And this is the point of the book: not to denigrate any particular culture, but to figure out how all people can improve their quality of life. In the words of Harrison, who pens the book's concluding essay, "It offers an important insight into why some countries and ethnic/religious groups have done better than others, not just in economic terms but also with respect to consolidation of democratic institutions and social justice. And those lessons of experience, which are increasingly finding practical application, particularly in Latin America, may help to illuminate the path to progress for that substantial majority of the world's people for whom prosperity, democracy, and social justice have remained out of reach." <i>--John J.

In this profound study he shows how the Masters have guided humanity over millennia, their working with Rudolf Steiner and the founding of anthroposophy, with particular reference to the Christ Being and the events at the Turning Point of Time. Also considered are particular aspects of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s own development and Initiation, his founding of the new mysteries during the Christmas Conference of 1923&#x2013;24, and Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s own position within the circle of Masters.<br><br>&#x201c;What has for nearly two millennia belonged only to a narrow circle of Christian initiates can, thanks to Anthroposophy, from our time onward become accessible to every person of goodwill who wants to understand through it the &#x2018;intentions of the living Christ,&#x2019; in order, out of freedom, to further their fulfillment on the Earth. As a result, it has for the first time become possible for human beings to unite their spiritual aims with the spiritual aims of the leading Masters of esoteric Christianity and, on this path, to enter the circle of the true &#x2018;friends of God.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Following the death of the translator and other obstacles, this book was never published within Sergei Prokofieff&#x2019;s lifetime, and the publishing of it has only now become possible following the completion of its translation from the original Russian.</p><p><b>Sergei O. Prokofieff</b>&nbsp;(1954&#x2013;2014) was born in Moscow, where he studied fine arts and painting at the Moscow School of Art. At an early age he encountered the work of Rudolf Steiner and quickly realized that his life would be dedicated to the Christian path of esoteric knowledge. He wrote his first book, <i>Rudolf Steiner and the Founding of the New Mysteries,</i>&nbsp;while living in Soviet Russia, and it was published in English in 1994. After the fall of Communism, he helped establish the Anthroposophical Society in Russia. In 2001, he became a member of the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum in Switzerland. More than 30 of his books have been translated into English.

Crusaders amassed possessions of all sorts, from castles to reliquaries. Campaigns required material funds and equipment, while conquests produced bureaucracies, taxation, economic exploitation, and commercial regulation. Wealth sustained the Crusades while material objects, from weaponry and military technology to carpentry and shipping, conditioned them.<br> &nbsp;<br> This lavishly illustrated volume considers the material trappings of crusading wars and the objects that memorialized them, in architecture, sculpture, jewelry, painting, and manuscripts. Christopher Tyerman&#x2019;s incorporation of the physical and visual remains of crusading enriches our understanding of how the crusaders themselves articulated their mission, how they viewed their place in the world, and how they related to the cultures they derived from and preyed upon.<br><br> A note to readers: the grey-shaded pages throughout this volume look at the Crusades in detail, exploring individual themes such as food and drink, medicine, weapons and women&#x2019;s role in the Crusades. These short essays are interspersed throughout the chapters and the main text will continue after each one.

After years of slave labor, starvation, disease, and torture, their worst fears were about to be realized. On December 14, with machine guns trained on them, they were herded underground into shallow air raid shelters&#x2014;death pits dug with their own hands.&nbsp;<br><br>Japanese soldiers doused the shelters with gasoline and set them on fire. Some thirty prisoners managed to bolt from the fiery carnage, running a lethal gauntlet of machine gun fire and bayonets to jump from the cliffs to the rocky Palawan coast. By the next morning, only eleven men were left alive&#x2014;but their desperate journey to freedom had just begun.&nbsp;<br><br><i>As Good as Dead </i>is one of the greatest escape stories of World War II, and one that few Americans know. The eleven survivors of the Palawan Massacre&#x2014;some badly wounded and burned&#x2014;spent weeks evading Japanese patrols. They scrounged for food and water, swam shark-infested bays, and wandered through treacherous jungle terrain, hoping to find friendly Filipino guerrillas. Their endurance, determination, and courage in the face of death make this a gripping and inspiring saga of survival.</p><p><b>Stephen L.

Sixty feet above, atop the steep bluff overlooking the rocky coastline, black smoke rose into the blue sky, a vivid reminder of the unspeakable horrors he had just escaped, scraping through the barbed wire fencing and tumbling down the cliff toward the Sulu Sea below.</p><p>Bogue&#x2019;s body was a mass of injuries. His hands and torso had been slashed as he plunged through the razor wire. His right leg throbbed from a rifle bullet embedded in his thigh, and his bare feet were lacerated and bloody from running along the rough coral beach. As he hid behind the boulders, nearly naked, trying to catch his breath and wondering what to do, two POWs ran past him in an attempt to swim to freedom. Both men were cut down by Japanese riflemen.</p><p>It was December 14, 1944. For twenty-eight months, Bogue had slaved as a prisoner of war for the Imperial Japanese Army, working to build the second-largest airfield in the region&#x2014;one being used to attack Allied forces in the Philippines. He had endured unbearable heat and humidity, illness, physical abuse and torture, and near starvation, and his once-powerful frame had been reduced to skin and bones. That dismal life now seemed merciful in comparison.</p><p>All around him, Bogue could hear the screams of other Americans being slaughtered as they tried to escape. If he ran for it, he knew he might be shot down like the rest. If he stayed put&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Either way, the odds were stacked against him. He had to do something, and quickly.</p><p>One thought raced through his mind: <i>They&#x2019;re going to hunt us down and kill every last one of us.</i></p><p></p><br><p></p><p><b>Part One</b></p><p>Bataan</p><p></p><br><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>The Death March</p><p>It was a time when even the most optimistic of souls had little left to believe in. American servicemen, who just a year earlier had relished duty in the Philippines for its enviable life, now questioned their purpose. They were men abandoned by their own government, left to hold out against a fate already cast, and now, late in the afternoon of April 8, 1942, their five-day fight for freedom and survival was nearing its futile end.</p><p>Still, Beto Pacheco was not about to surrender. Handsome, athletic, and quick to flash a toothy smile in better times, the private first class now looked like a bum: His once-sharp uniform had been reduced to rags, his shoes were nearly worn through, and even his underwear was in shreds. Weeks of exposure to the brutal tropical sun had burned his skin, but Pacheco&#x2019;s Spanish and Mexican ancestry had at least provided him more natural protection than some of his fair-complected companions.</p><p>The air smelled of death, dirt, smoke, and gunpowder. The once-lush green jungles were denuded of vegetation, swept bare by endless weeks of pounding artillery and aerial bombardments from the Imperial Japanese Army. Explosions sent shock waves through the earth around Pacheco as he and his comrades continued firing back with their few antiaircraft guns that were still marginally operational. Silver-winged Japanese warplanes flashed past, unleashing violent bomb blasts and chattering rounds of machine-gun bullets that shredded the nearby jungle surrounding the last two American airfields on the Bataan Peninsula.</p><p>For Pacheco, the last stand at Bataan was a true test of his devout Catholic faith. At one point, as a strong force flung him from his foxhole, he felt as if the hand of God had saved him. A brilliant red-orange blast left him no time to determine whether a nearby artillery round had propelled him. When the acrid black smoke parted, two of his comrades lay dead in the hole from which he had been thrown.</p><p>Even surrounded by the din of battle, he could feel the gnawing hunger in his gut. Army rations had been gone for weeks. The American and Filipino troops had exhausted their meager supplies of rice and canned goods, and by now they had even hunted the native wildlife in the vicinity to extinction. Pacheco had learned to eat anything&#x2014;from the insides of palm trees to iguanas, snakes, crickets, and even worms. He was a slight man, standing five foot nine and weighing only 160 pounds when the war started. His weight had dropped quickly, and by this point he would have killed for a bite of wild boar meat, or even a freshly picked mango. But food was not an option.</p><p>Beto Pacheco&#x2019;s U.S. Army regiment, the 200th Coast Artillery, was hanging on by threads along with its sister unit, the 515th Coast Artillery Regiment&#x2014;the last remnants of resistance facing the Japanese on the tip of a peninsula of Luzon Island in the Philippines. The men were firing back at the surging Japanese forces threatening to overrun the Cabcaben and Bataan airfields. Dirty, dehydrated, and exhausted, Pacheco was nonetheless determined to fight beside his comrades to the very end. And now Army brass was spreading the news that the end had come.</p><p>At 0300 on April 9, Captain Albert Fields returned from the I Corps headquarters and told his executive officer, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all over.&#x201d; Runners reached Pacheco&#x2019;s artillery unit before dawn with orders that the 200th and 515th were to rendezvous on the road west of Cabcaben by 2200. But first, they were to destroy their antiaircraft guns and range equipment, leaving them just their rifles. <i>We&#x2019;re being reduced to infantrymen!</i> Pacheco thought with disgust.[i]</p><p>The disheartened men dutifully sabotaged their weapons and marched out with rifles, canteens, bayonets, and a belt of ammunition each. Men much older than Pacheco trudged along with tears streaming down their dusty, blood-caked faces as they carried out the dreaded orders. The young soldier brushed aside his wavy, dark hair&#x2014;untrimmed long enough to hang over his sweaty brow&#x2014;adjusted his gear, and moved forward. He was armed with only a rusting 1903 model&nbsp;.306-caliber Springfield bolt-action rifle, but he still had his pride.</p><p>Somehow, some way, he intended to carry on the fight. He was not about to willingly surrender himself to the Japanese.</p><p>Pacheco&#x2019;s 200th Coast Artillery unit had been the first to fire on the Japanese warplanes that swept over Manila on December 8, 1941. Seven hours earlier&#x2014;December 7 Hawaii time&#x2014;Japanese carrier aircraft had unleashed a devastating surprise assault on the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. With the capture of the Philippines critical to Japan&#x2019;s effort to control the Southwest Pacific, their planes attacked within hours the main aviation bases on Manila and the headquarters of the United States Asiatic Fleet at Cavite. In only a single day Japan gained air superiority over the Philippines and forced the surviving ships of the U.S. fleet to withdraw from Cavite.</p><p>Tens of thousands of American military personnel were left stranded on the ground in and around Manila, the Philippine capital. Pacheco&#x2019;s 200th Coast Artillery, the only American antiaircraft unit on Luzon, had been assigned to protect nearly three dozen B-17 bombers on Clark Field with their single battery of&nbsp;.50-caliber machine guns, twenty-one 37mm guns, and a dozen three-inch antiaircraft guns. Prior to that day, Pacheco&#x2019;s unit had never actually fired a live round of ammunition in the islands.[ii] Yet since firing that first shot at the Japanese on December 8, Pacheco&#x2019;s antiaircraft regiment had expended some forty thousand rounds in the months that followed. They had been credited with destroying eighty-six Japanese aircraft&#x2014;a proud accomplishment, but not nearly enough to save the Philippines.</p><p>The 200th Coast Artillery, formerly the 111th Cavalry of the New Mexico National Guard, had arrived in the Philippines in August 1941. The unit was composed of eighteen hundred artillery specialists, more than half of whom were New Mexicans from Spanish-speaking border and mountain communities that used little English. The New Mexico National Guard, the oldest continuously active militia in the United States, dating to 1598, had participated in the Mexican War, the Civil War, and the frontier Indian wars. New Mexico&#x2019;s militiamen had charged up San Juan Hill with Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s Rough Riders, had ridden against Pancho Villa&#x2019;s banditos south of the Rio Grande, and had served in France during World War I.[iii]</p><p>Now hundreds of these proud men were moving out, overwhelmed, while other antiaircraft batteries continued firing back at the approaching enemy. Its companies were widely scattered, hanging on to what little ground they could still hold. Pacheco, a battlewise veteran after four months of hell on Luzon, knew that the last stand of the 200th would be short-lived.</p><p>He had heard others whisper the word <i>surrender</i>. The heavily reinforced Japanese forces sweeping down the Bataan Peninsula had pounded the dug-in Americans with blistering air and artillery fire for days. The Japanese had broken through Allied lines on April 7, and the following day, the senior U.S. commander on Bataan, Major General Edward P. King, had seen the futility of further resistance. He began offering plans for capitulation.</p><p>As they hustled along, Pacheco tried to offer encouragement to some of the younger men in his Headquarters Battery. Several of his hometown companions from Deming, New Mexico&#x2014;Angelo Sakelares, Lawrence &#x201c;Buddy&#x201d; Byrne, and Jim Huxtable&#x2014;had been wearing high school graduation caps and gowns just months ago. By August 1941, these fresh-faced boys on the cusp of manhood had been selected for overseas duty in the Philippines by virtue of their reputation as the best antiaircraft regiment in the U.S. Armed Forces. Now they were starving, grimy, and haggard, clothed in tatters, and facing a defeat the likes of which no modern American unit had been forced to reckon with.[iv]</p><p>In early 1941, the 200th had trained at Fort Bliss, the Army&#x2019;s second-largest installation, headquartered in El Paso, Texas. There, Pacheco had met sixteen-year-old Catalina &#x201c;Katie&#x201d; Valles, an attractive girl with green eyes and long, dark brown hair. The two were soon an item, and even began dreaming of a future together&#x2014;against the wishes of her father, because she was so young. Pacheco&#x2019;s plans took a sudden detour with the selection of the 200th for overseas assignment. He promised Katie he would be gone only a year. When they returned, they could get married and start a life together.</p><p>If his proud regiment was now truly surrendering to the Japanese, that future with Katie seemed an impossibility.</p><p>The American surrender on the Bataan Peninsula had been months in the making.</p><p>Pacheco&#x2019;s artillery regiment had started the war based at Fort Stotsenburg, which abutted Clark Field some seventy-five miles north of Manila. The destruction of the B-17s at Clark in December forced the 200th and 515th to withdraw to Bataan by the first of 1942. There, the artillery regiments had set up their antiaircraft defenses in and around Manila to protect the airstrips at Cabcaben and Bataan, where only seven P-40s were still flying by the first of the year.</p><p>By January 9, the strung-out artillery regiments were already living on reduced rations as the drubbing of Japanese artillery signaled the beginning of the Battle of Bataan. Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma, a graduate of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1907, had landed his troops of the Japanese 14th Army at Lingayen Gulf on Luzon and advanced toward Manila. His army found little resistance at first, as General Douglas MacArthur had ordered his own forces to withdraw from the capital city to the Bataan Peninsula. During the early months of the siege, MacArthur was fed false hope from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who promised hundreds of planes and thousands of troops. To await his reinforcements, the general took up headquarters more than two miles across the water from Bataan on Corregidor Island, known to most as &#x201c;the Rock.&#x201d;</p><p>MacArthur was unaware that as early as late December 1941, President Roosevelt and War Secretary Henry Stimson had already privately written off the remote outpost of Bataan&#x2014;a decision they confided in with Winston Churchill. In so doing, Washington had also forsaken the Philippines and all of its defenders.</p><p>The four-month stand made by General King&#x2019;s men had been doomed from the start. The American troops in Manila were unable to receive supplies and ammunition due to their own crippled Navy and the blockade that the Imperial Japanese Navy had placed on the Philippines. Now, on April 9, King, adorned in his last clean uniform, was prepared to surrender to General Homma some seventy-eight thousand American and Filipino soldiers under his command. By doing so, he hoped to avoid a slaughter.</p><p>The Americans had agreed to a cease-fire, but the Japanese ignored the surrender talks and kept right on bombing into the morning of April 9. One artillery officer told Pacheco&#x2019;s gun crew that they could either flee into the hills near Bataan or head across the bay for Corregidor. The officer was going to the island, so Pacheco decided to follow.[v]</p><p>They were just two among hundreds of other Americans who headed for the coast several miles away in search of passage to Corregidor, determined to avoid surrender. One of them was Seaman First Class Bruce Gordon Elliott, a dark-haired teenager with bushy eyebrows and a poker face that helped hide that he was just shy of his nineteenth birthday. On the beach at Mariveles, Pacheco, Elliott, and many others found mass confusion&#x2014;hundreds of frustrated servicemen milling about with no more boats left to transport them across the bay.[vi]</p><p>As many as two thousand Filipinos and Americans, including nurses at the local hospitals, would manage to escape Bataan during the surrender by taking to boats and barges&#x2014;or some even by swimming. Yet Pacheco, Elliott, and many other soldiers had emerged from the jungle too late to catch any of the outgoing launches. They found the water dotted with hundreds of swimmers attempting to cross the bay. Some were hanging on to lifeboats or bamboo rafts, or clinging to floating debris.[vii]</p><p>Though it was two and a half miles across choppy, shark-infested waters swirling with dangerous undercurrents to reach Corregidor, Pacheco and Elliott individually decided to join those swimming for the island rather than surrendering to the Japanese. The tides helped push the men out toward sea, but soon they were exhausted. Bruce Elliott had been swimming for about six hours, feeling that he was about to drown at any minute, when a launch plucked him from the sea in only his skivvies. Pacheco had made it only a third of the way before a small Filipino fishing boat came along and its crew pulled him from the water. He and several others were transferred to a larger Navy launch.</p><p>Safely aboard the Navy interisland boat, Pacheco was reunited with other members of his artillery unit. The men lay flat on the steel deck as Japanese planes strafed and bombed the boats bobbing across Manila Ba...</p></p><h2>The Contrite Spirit: How the Temple Helps Us Apply Christ&#39;s Atonement</h2><p>A friend once asked Elder Bruce C. Hafen, If Jesus Christ is at the center of the gospel and the center of the temple, why doesn t the temple endowment teach the story of the life of Christ? What s all this about Adam and Eve? After thinking about this provocative question, Elder Hafen concluded, I have come to believe that the story of Christ s life is the story of giving His Atonement, and the story of Adam and Eve is the story of receiving His Atonement and their story is our story. In The Contrite Spirit, Elder and Sister Hafen use the lens of the temple to share their insights about receiving the Atonement of Jesus Christ, shedding further light on the central doctrine of the gospel while deepening our understanding of temple ordinances. As we further explore the Atonement based on the covenants of the temple, we will better understand how the Atonement applies to us.</p><p></p><h2>The Inner Life of Cats: The Science and Secrets of Our Mysterious Feline Companions</h2><p><b>Our feline companions are much-loved but often mysterious.

Following the recognition of these common truths it continues, leading the spiritual aspirant into refuge in the Three Supreme Jewels and, for a Mahayanist (whose selfless attitude is based on pure love and compassion), into activation of the awakening mind - bodhicitta. The work then unites these meditations with a series of practices exclusive to the tantric path - Vajrasattva purification, mandala offering, union with the spiritual master, the chod practice of cutting duality at its source and so forth.

But that&#x2019;s not the reason why it is still remembered. On May 23, 1992, a roadside explosion killed the Palermo judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three police officers. A few weeks later judge Paolo Borsellino and five police officers were killed in the center of Palermo. These anti-mafia judges became heroes but the violence spread to the region of Bari in Puglia, where we meet a new, memorable character, Maresciallo Pietro Fenoglio, an officer of the Italian Carabinieri. Fenoglio, recently abandoned by his wife, must simultaneously deal with his personal crisis and the new gang wars raging around Bari. The police are stymied until a gang member, accused of killing a child, decides to collaborate, revealing the inner workings and the rules governing organised crime in the area. The story is narrated through the actual testimony of the informant, a trope reminiscent of verbatim theatre which Carofiglio, an ex-anti-mafia judge himself, uses to great effect. The gangs are stopped but the mystery of the boy&#x2019;s murder must still be solved, leading Fenoglio into a world of deep moral ambiguity, where the prosecutors are hard to distinguish from the prosecuted.</p><p>Gianrico Carofiglio was born in Bari in 1961 and has worked for many years as a prosecutor specialized in organized crime. He was appointed advisor of the anti-Mafia committee in the Italian parliament in 2007 and has served as senator from 2008 to 2013. He is the author of the novels featuring the character of defense lawyer Guido Guerrieri: A Walk in the Dark, 2003,Temporary Perfections, 2010, A Fine Line, 2014. He was awarded the Premio Gargano Vincenzo Afferrante in 2015, and the Premio Letterario Castelfiorentino in 2016.

Meanwhile, our legislators can't even follow their own rules for making rules, while the rule of law mutates into a perpetual state of emergency. The legal system is becoming an incomprehensible farce.<br><br>How did this happen? In <i>The Nonsense Factory</i>, Bruce Cannon Gibney shows that over the past seventy years, the legal system has dangerously confused quantity with quality and might with legitimacy. As the law bloats into chaos, it staggers on only by excusing itself from the very commands it insists that we obey, leaving Americans at the mercy of arbitrary power. By examining the system as a whole, Gibney shows that the tragedies often portrayed as isolated mistakes or the work of bad actors-police misconduct, prosecutorial overreach, and the outrages of imperial presidencies-are really the inevitable consequences of law's descent into lawlessness.<br><br>The first book to deliver a lucid, comprehensive overview of the entire legal system, from the grandeur of Constitutional theory to the squalid workings of Congress, <i>The Nonsense Factory</i> provides a deeply researched and witty examination of America's state of legal absurdity, concluding with sensible options for reform.<br></p><p><b>Bruce Cannon Gibney</b> is the author of <i>A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America.</i> A venture capitalist and writer, Gibney began as an attorney specializing in securities litigation and financial regulation.

He and his colleagues have funded Facebook, Spotify, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, Lyft, AirBnB, Coupang, and DeepMind."<i>The Nonsense Factory</i> is a provocative polemic on the sorry state of American law. Whether you chiefly blame the Supreme Court or Congress or law professors or We The People ourselves--and whether or not you buy into every count of his indictment--Gibney's book raises serious questions about how we govern ourselves."&#x2015;<b><i>David A. Kaplan, author of <i>The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside the Supreme Court's Assault on the Constitution</i></i></b><br><br>"A diligent, carefully considered overview of the law and its many facets.... Gibney is an insurrectionist with a heavy mind but a light heart.... His overarching intellectual project is a deeply admirable, and indeed, a patriotic one. He's willing to take a little heat to get some new ideas out there, and he's willing to make a few enemies in the process. By applying his deeply agile mind to the seemingly intractable obstacles of our democracy, he implicitly and crucially demonstrates the belief that real solutions exist."&#x2015;<b><i>Lawyers, Guns, and Money<br></i></b><br><br>"Really interesting book... stirring the pot."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>The Young Turks<br></i></b><br><br>"A keen, lively deconstruction of the American legal system's seemingly countless flaws." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus Reviews<br></i></i></b><br><br>"Gibney is ... often funny, and his criticisms are serious, well-argued, and provocative."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Gibney (<i>A Generation of Sociopaths</i>) boldly declares that these chaotic times have been long-developing in the legal realm....

(Terra Nova)</h2><p>There are many well-established scientific reasons that the HIV/AIDS hypothesis is highly doubtful. In <i>Science Sold Out</i>, Rebecca Culshaw describes her slow uncovering of these reasons over her years researching HIV for her work constructing mathematical models of its interaction with the immune system. It is rare that a researcher who has received funding to study HIV ever expresses any doubt in the paradigm, and an even rarer event still when she abandons the field altogether. This book focuses on the changing definition of AIDS and the flaws in all HIV testing. In a much broader sense, it explains how the current, government-based structure of scientific research has corrupted science as the search for truth. It offers not only scientific reasons for HIV/AIDS being untenable, but also sociological explanations as to how the theory was accepted by the media and the world so quickly. In particular, this book offers a scathing criticism of the outrageous discriminatory measures that have been leveled at HIV-positives from the inception.</p><p>Rebecca Culshaw lives in Tyler, Texas, where she is assistant professor of mathematics at The University of Texas at Tyler. She came to the U.S. in 2002, after receiving her Ph.D. in mathematics from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Culshaw has resided in Texas, Iowa, Nova Scotia, London, Ottawa, and Mzuzu, Malawi. She has published several journal articles regarding mathematical modeling of HIV immunology, and serves on the Advisory Board of Journal of Biological Systems.<br><br>Dr. Harvey Bialy has written the foreword to this book. Dr. Bialy is currently Scholar in Residence at National Autonomous University in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Prior to his retirement, he was founding editor of Nature Biotechnology, a sister journal to Nature. Dr. Bialy is author of <i>Oncogenes, Aneuploidy, and AIDS: A Scientific Life and Times of Peter H. Duesberg.</i>"An excellent account of the most shameful episode in the history of medicine. Rebecca Culshaw has pulled it all together: a history of inept and dishonest AIDS &#x2018;science,&#x2019; the manifold reasons HIV cannot be the cause of AIDS, the harmfulness of AIDS drugs, the physical and psychological human suffering caused by the AIDS hoax."<br>&#x2014;John Lauritsen, author of Poison By Prescription: The AZT Story and The AIDS War<br><br>"Every mathematician knows that by changing the definition of something, you can change the entire truth about that thing. Rebecca Culshaw describes how the HIV = AIDS &#x2018;orthodoxists&#x2019; have abused this idea. As in a shell game, they keep moving the definitions around, so that anything can be true and everyone will be confused. The abuse of science that has been documented here is itself very frightening.

Winston Churchill has just been sworn in, war rages across the Channel, and the threat of a Blitz looms larger by the day. But none of this deters Maggie Hope.

Her indefatigable spirit and remarkable gifts for codebreaking, though, rival those of even the highest men in government, and Maggie finds that working for the prime minister affords her a level of clearance she could never have imagined&#x2014;and opportunities she will not let pass. In troubled, deadly times, with air-raid sirens sending multitudes underground, access to the War Rooms also exposes Maggie to the machinations of a menacing faction determined to do whatever it takes to change the course of history.<br><br>Ensnared in a web of spies, murder, and intrigue, Maggie must work quickly to balance her duty to King and Country with her chances for survival.

Some of these metaphors are familiar and soothing; others are unfamiliar and confusing. Still others portray God in ways that are difficult and uncomfortable--God as abusive husband, for instance, or as neglectful father. Julia O'Brien searches the prophetic books for these metaphors, looking for ways in which the different images intersect and build off each other. When confronted with disturbing metaphors, she deals with them unflinchingly, providing a sharp critique and evaluation of the interpretations of these metaphors for God. Giving particular attention to the possible uses of these metaphors in the church today--for good or ill--O'Brien listens to the fullness of the prophetic messages and points us toward new ways to read these theological metaphors for a just faith today.</p></p><p><b>Julia M. O'Brien</b> is Professor of Old Testament and the Paul H. and Grace L. Stern Chair in Old Testament Studies at Lancaster Theological Seminary in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She is the author of several books on the Old Testament prophets.An indispensable resource for theological reflection on the prophets! O&#39;Brien knows that we cannot read responsibly unless we wrestle with the social ideologies underlying biblical metaphors. Here she offers lucid exegesis, candid observations about interpretive method, and lively cultural criticism, along with stories from her life as a teacher and parent. Compelling and accessible, this book is essential reading for preachers, seminary students, and anyone who seeks a deeper understanding of the prophets. --Carolyn J.

Th�r�se had an extraordinary penetration into the heart of Jesus&#x2019; teaching, something she developed into a program for daily life. Although she was only twenty-four years old when she died, Th�r�se had an extraordinary spiritual maturity. Father Keating writes about the teachings of Jesus in the parables and then shows what extraordinary insight Th�r�se had into those enigmatic sayings. <br><br> According to Father Keating, St. Th�r�se tried to live the Gospel precept, "To love one another as I have loved you!" on a daily basis. She believed it was the best program to propose to people because anybody could do it and because the Kingdom of God was, and is, in everyday life and in what we, as individuals, do with it. As Father Keating shows, St. Th�r�se&#x2019;s teaching continues to reveal to us that if we only build up instead of tear down others and fully and lovingly trust that Christ is with us until the end of time we will be transformed.</p><p><b>Thomas Keating</b> is a founding member and the spiritual guide of Contemplative Outreach. He has served on Contemplative Outreach's Board of Trustees since the organization's beginning and is currently serving as the Chairman of the Board. Fr.

He is the author of many books, including Open Mind, Open Heart; Fruits and Gifts of the Spirit; Manifesting God; and Invitation to Love. He lives at St. Benedict&#x2019;s Monastery, Snowmass, Colorado.Keating, one of the founders of the Centering Prayer movement and author of the very popular Open Mind, Open Heart, here addresses himself to the enigma of St. Therese of Lisieux, using six of the parables of Jesus as his vehicle. Keating's essay is not wholly successful in that he is hard pressed to do justice to Jesus, Therese, and himself in less than 100 pages but Therese's story and her refreshing experience of faith have been of perennial and indeed almost inexhaustible interest since her death at the age of 24 in 1897. Many readers will enjoy making her acquaintance for the first time, or again, and Keating's readers should enjoy his amplifications of her message.

A regular contributor to <em>The New Yorker</em>, Hadley returns to the short story form in this brilliant collection, her first since the celebrated <em>Sunstroke and Other Stories</em>. <em>Married Love</em> showcases beautifully her formidable talent for writing domestic fiction that rises about the genre to become literary art.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2012:</strong> Novels and stories being such different beasts, it's rare to find a writer gifted at both: the quick sketches and implications of a short piece; the steady build and satisfying arc of an extended one. Four-time novelist Tessa Hadley deftly handles any length, as her outstanding new collection confirms. Despite the book's title, <i>Married Love</i>, these dozen taut stories are decidedly unsentimental. In "Friendly Fire," a middle-aged mother cleans toilets in a warehouse, reflecting on her hapless husband and soldier son; in "Post Production," a film director dies suddenly in his kitchen, leaving a bizarre tangle of relationships behind. Hadley has a special talent for opening lines: "After the sex, he fell asleep," reads one. Only a writer at the top of her game could make you care what happens next. You will. --<i>Mia Lipman</i><p><em>Married Love</em> is a masterful collection of short fiction from one of today&#x2019;s most accomplished storytellers. These tales showcase the qualities for which Tessa Hadley has long been praised: her humor, warmth, and psychological acuity; her powerful, precise, and emotionally dense prose; her unflinching examinations of family relationships. Here are stories that range widely across generations and classes, exploring the private and public lives of unforgettable characters: a young girl who haunts the edges of her parents&#x2019; party; a wife released by the sudden death of her film-director husband; an eighteen-year-old who insists on marrying her music professor, only to find herself shut out from his secrets. In this stunning collection, Hadley evokes worlds that expand in the imagination far beyond the pages, capturing domestic dramas, generational sagas, wrenching love affairs and epiphanies, and distilling them to remarkable effect.</p></p><h2>My Adventures as a Spy (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)</h2><p>Written during the first years of World War I by a British military hero, this charming volume introduces the essentials of spycraft. Sir Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts and storyteller extraordinaire, developed his spying skills in South Africa and conducted some of his most inspired work in the Balkans, where he worked undercover as a butterfly hunter. In brief, breezy chapters, he explains how to adopt disguises, hide messages, create diversions, escape capture, and perform other thrilling maneuvers. <br>"A good spy no matter which country he serves is of necessity a brave and valuable fellow," Baden-Powell declares. His attitude toward espionage as a sport, in which the players appreciate and honor each other, brings the emotional exhilaration of a well-played game to these tales of danger and adventure.

Noteworthy selections include Elegy for a Demon Lover, which chronicles Booth's entanglement with a seductive otherworldly entity who teaches him about pleasure and pain and the shadowed places in-between. In the brilliantly Lovecraftian Bringing Helena Back, Booth agrees to help an old college friend bring his wife back from the dead, with horrifying results. Booth also investigates the skeleton of a woman sealed within the basement walls of the museum where he works, a house haunted by the spirit of a young girl and the ghost of a murdered private school student.

One is from Charlotte saying she finished early and decided to meet up with our boss, so she&#x2019;ll see me at Toby&#x2019;s house later. One is from Toby, saying, 7 p.m.: Don&#x2019;t forget! And three are from Morgan.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t read those yet.</p><p>I head off campus and a few blocks over to where I parked my car in an attempt to avoid the daily after-school gridlock. But of course the driver&#x2019;s side lock won&#x2019;t unlock when I turn the key, so I have to go around the passenger side and open the door and climb across the seat to pull up the other lock and shut the passenger door and go around to the driver&#x2019;s side again&#x2014;and by the time I&#x2019;m through with that twenty-second process, the cars are already backed up at the light. So I inch into the road and pull out my phone and read what Morgan wrote.</p><p>You okay?</p><p>R u coming to set later? </p><p>I miss you.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t write back. I am going straight to set, but not to see her. I need to measure the space between a piano and a bookshelf to see if the music stand I found on Abbot Kinney Boulevard yesterday will make things look too crowded. The music stand is beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that if it doesn&#x2019;t fit I will find a new bookshelf, or rearrange the furniture entirely, because this is exactly what I would have in my practice room if I knew how to play an instrument. And if I could afford a nine-hundred-dollar music stand.</p><p>As the light turns and I roll my car through the intersection, I&#x2019;m trying to ignore Morgan&#x2019;s texts and think only of the music stand. This music stand is a miracle. It&#x2019;s exactly what I didn&#x2019;t even know I was looking for. The part that holds the sheet music is this perfect oxidized green. When I texted my boss a picture of the stand she wrote back, Fucking amazing!!!! An expletive and four exclamation marks. And when I texted Morgan to tell her that this was the last time I would allow myself to get dumped by her, that breaking up and getting back together six times was already insane, and there was absolutely no way I would take her back a seventh, she replied with, I don&#x2019;t know what to do! Indecisive and only mildly emphatic. So typical.</p><p>But the music stand, the music stand.</p><p>Turning right onto La Cienega, my phone rings and it&#x2019;s Charlotte.</p><p>&#x201c;You need to come here,&#x201d; she says. </p><p>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ginger took me to an estate sale.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A good one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You just have to come.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Someone famous?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds fun but I need to measure for that music stand.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Emi,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Trust me. You need to come here now.&#x201d; </p><p>So I scribble down the address, make a U-turn, and head toward the Hollywood Hills. I drive up Sunset and roll down all the windows, partly because the air-conditioning doesn&#x2019;t work and it&#x2019;s ninety degrees, but mostly because I&#x2019;m driving past palm trees and hundreds of beauty parlors and taco trucks and doughnut shops and clothing stores and nightclubs, and I like to take it all in and think about how Los Angeles is the best place in the world.</p><p>I turn when my phone tells me to turn and start ascending the hills, where the roads become narrower and the houses more expensive. I keep going, higher than I&#x2019;ve ever gone, until the houses are not only way bigger and nicer than the already big, nice houses below them, but also farther apart. And, finally, I turn into a driveway that I&#x2019;m pretty sure has never before encountered a beat-up hatchback with locks that don&#x2019;t work.</p><p>I park under the branches of old, gorgeous trees that are full and green in spite of the arrival of summer, step out of my car, lean against the bumper, and take a look at this house. My job has taken me to a lot of ridiculously nice houses, but this one stands out. It&#x2019;s older and grander, but there&#x2019;s more to it than that. It just feels different. More significant. I&#x2019;m not thinking about Morgan and thinking instead about who might have owned this house. It was probably someone old, which is good, because an estate sale means someone has died, and it&#x2019;s sad to dig through thirty-year-old people&#x2019;s stuff and think about the futures they could have had.</p><p>The double front doors swing open and Charlotte steps into the sun. Her jeans are rolled up at the ankles and her blond hair is in pigtails, and her face is part serious, part elated.</p><p>&#x201c;Guess,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>I try to think of who has died in the last couple of weeks. My first thought is our physics teacher&#x2019;s grandmother, but I seriously doubt she would have lived in a house like this one. Then I think of someone else, but I don&#x2019;t say anything because the thought is crazy. This death is huge. Front-page huge. Every-time-I-turn-on-the-radio huge.</p><p>But then&#x2014;there&#x2019;s this house, which is clearly an important house, and old, beautiful trees, and Charlotte&#x2019;s mouth, which is twitching under the tremendous effort of not smiling.</p><p>Plus it isn&#x2019;t swarming with people, which means this is some kind of preview that Ginger got invited to because she&#x2019;s a famous production designer and she always gets called to these things first.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>And Charlotte starts nodding. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious.&#x201d;</p><p>Her hands fly to her face because she&#x2019;s giddy with the delirious laughter of someone who has spent the last hour in the house of a man who was arguably the most emblematic actor in American cinema.</p><p>Clyde Jones. Icon of the American Western.</p><p>She leans against the house, doubles over, slides onto the marble landing. I let her have one of her rare hysterical fits of laughter as I take it all in. I can&#x2019;t think of enough expletives to perfectly capture this moment. I would need a year&#x2019;s worth of exclamation points. So I just stare, openmouthed, thinking of the man who used to live here.</p><p>Charlotte&#x2019;s hysterics die down, and soon she is standing, composed again, back to her super-brilliant, future museum-studies-major self.</p><p>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>I pause in the colossal doorway. Outside is bright and hot, a beautiful Los Angeles day. Inside it&#x2019;s darker. I can feel the air-conditioning escaping. Even though this is an amazing opportunity that will never come again, I don&#x2019;t know if I should go any farther. The thing is this: My brother, Toby, and I talk all the time about what movies do. They speak to our desires, which are never small. They allow us to escape and to dream and to gaze into eyes that are impossibly beautiful and huge. When you live in LA and work in the movies, you experience the collapse of some of that fantasy. You know that the eyes glow like that because of lights placed at a specific angle, and you see the actresses up close and, yes, they are beautiful, but they are human size and imperfect like the rest of us.</p><p>This, though, is different.</p><p>Because even if you know a little bit too much about how movies are made, there are always things you don&#x2019;t know. You can hold on to the myth surrounding the actors; you can get swept up in the story.</p><p>Clyde Jones belongs in the Old West. He belongs under the stars, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and listening to the wind. In A Long Time Till Tomorrow he lived in a log cabin. In Lowlands he lived out of a green pickup truck, sleeping by the side of the road a couple hours at a time, searching for a woman from his past.</p><p>Clyde Jones is the savior. The good, uncomplicated man. The perfect cowboy. But as soon as I walk through this doorway he will be an actor who spent his life in a Los Angeles mansion. The ultimate collapse of the fantasy.</p><p>&#x201c;Em?&#x201d; Charlotte says. She steps to the left, gesturing that I should follow, and I can&#x2019;t help myself. A moment later I&#x2019;m in Clyde Jones&#x2019;s foyer, the doors shut behind me, gazing at one of the most beautiful objects I&#x2019;ve ever beheld: a low-hanging chandelier, geometric and silver and shining.</p><p>Clyde Jones was no cowboy, but his aesthetic sensibilities were amazing.</p><p>I&#x2019;m still dying over Clyde&#x2019;s house when Ginger strides past me.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, good, Emi, you made it.&#x201d; Charlotte and I follow her into the living room.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I say, standing under the high white-beamed ceiling, next to what I can only assume is a pair of original Swan chairs positioned under a huge pastoral landscape with a clear sky as endless as the skies in his films. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably better that I don&#x2019;t go to the studio today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These glasses,&#x201d; Ginger says, pointing, and Charlotte walks over to a shiny minibar and takes a tray of highball glasses. &#x201c;Why should you avoid the studio? Oh, let me guess: Morgan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She broke up with me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something about not being tied down. Life&#x2019;s vast possibilities.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018; Life&#x2019;s vast possibilities.&#x2019; Such bullshit,&#x201d; Charlotte says, setting the glasses next to a group of other beautiful objects that Ginger must have already chosen.</p><p>I say, &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; but only because that&#x2019;s what Charlotte needs me to say. Charlotte is the kind of friend who automatically hates everyone who has ever done me wrong. The first time Morgan broke up with me and we got back together, Charlotte tried her best to get over it and be nice to Morgan. But somewhere around the third time, Charlotte got rude. Stopped saying hi. Stopped smiling around her. By now, Charlotte can&#x2019;t even hear Morgan&#x2019;s name without clenching her jaw.</p><p>Ginger shoots me a sympathetic look.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done with movie people.&#x201d;</p><p>And then we all laugh, because really. What a ridiculous thing to say.</p><p>~</p><p>When Ginger is finished choosing what she wants, she lets Charlotte and me explore for a while and see if there&#x2019;s anything we want to buy. We find ourselves in Clyde&#x2019;s study, which has to be the size of my brother&#x2019;s entire apartment. It has high ceilings supported by thick wooden beams and an entire wall of windows with doors that slide open to the land in back. Of all the rooms, this one feels the most Western. There&#x2019;s an enormous rustic table that he must have used as a desk and a collection of leather chairs arranged in a semicircle facing a cavernous fireplace. Shelves line the entirety of one of the side walls, and covering the shelves are hundreds of awards including four Oscars, along with objects from his films: cowboy hats and guns and silver belt buckles.</p><p>Most people our age don&#x2019;t know or care very much about Clyde. His career is long over. His roles were rarely sophisticated or smart; there isn&#x2019;t much to recommend him to my generation. But my brother has eclectic tastes, and when he loves something, it becomes nearly impossible not to love it along with him. So over the years I became infatuated with the moment that Clyde appears on the horizon or in the saloon or riding through tall grass toward the woman he loves.</p><p>Standing in his study now feels both unexpected and inevitable. And, more than those things, it feels meaningful. Like all of Clyde&#x2019;s arrivals. Like, without knowing it, everything I&#x2019;ve done has been building toward this moment.</p><p>&#x201d;Are you all right?&#x201d; Charlotte asks me.</p><p>I just nod, because how could I describe this feeling in a way that would make sense? There is no logic behind it.</p><p>I pick up one of the belt buckles. It&#x2019;s heavier than I thought it would be, and more beautiful up close: the smooth silhouette of a bucking horse with a rough mountain and waning moon in the background.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to see how much they&#x2019;re asking for this,&#x201d; I say. </p><p>Charlotte cocks her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re choosing a belt buckle?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for Toby,&#x201d; I say, and Charlotte blushes because she&#x2019;s been in love with my brother forever. Reminded, I check my phone and see that we&#x2019;re supposed to meet up with him in just under two hours.</p><p>Charlotte&#x2019;s flipping through records. She pulls out a Patsy Cline album.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get over this,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Clyde Jones used to sit on these chairs and listen to this record.&#x201d;</p><p>We find Ginger signing a credit card slip for over twenty thousand dollars, which might explain why, when we show the estate sale man the belt buckle and Patsy Cline record, he beams at us and says, &#x201c;My gift to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Charlotte, will you get Harrison on the phone?&#x201d; Charlotte does, and hands the phone to the man to arrange a pickup, and then we are back in Clyde&#x2019;s hot drive- way, out of his house forever.</p><p>~</p><p>Toby lives in a classic LA courtyard apartment, like the one in David Lynch&#x2019;s film Mulholland Drive, which chooses to focus on the darker side of the movie business, and also the one in Melrose Place, which was a nineties TV show set in West Hollywood that my dad lectures about in his Pop Culture of Los Angeles course at UCLA. Toby&#x2019;s courtyard has a tidy green lawn and a pretty fountain, and from the side of his cottage you can see a tiny strip of the ocean. We walk in, and there is his stuff, packed, waiting by the door. A set of matching suitcases that look so grown up.</p><p>He hugs us both. Me first and long, Charlotte next and quicker. Then he stands and faces us, my tan brother with his crooked smile and black hair that&#x2019;s always in his eyes. I feel sad, and then I push the sadness away because of what we have to tell him.</p><p>&#x201c;Toby,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;We spent the afternoon in Clyde Jones&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re shitting me,&#x201d; he says, his eyes wide. </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Charlotte says. &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His house was full of the most amazing&#x2014;&#x201d; I start, but Toby puts his hands over his ears. </p><p>&#x201c;Dont&#x2019;tellmedon&#x2019;ttellmedon&#x2019;ttellme,&#x201d; he says. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;The collapse of the fantasy,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>I know, I mouth, all exaggerated so he can read my lips. </p><p>&#x201c;I love Clyde Jones,&#x201d; he says, dropping his hands.</p><p>I nod. &#x201c;Not another word on the subject,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;But I do have something for you. Close your eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>My brother does as told and holds out his hands. I pretend I don&#x2019;t notice Charlotte staring at him, and place the belt buckle in his cupped palms. He opens his eyes. Doesn&#x2019;t say anything. I wonder whether I chose the wrong object, and then I realize that tears are starting.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, please,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy. Shit.&#x201d; He blinks rapidly to compose himself. Then he rushes to his bookshelf of DVDs and pulls one out. He&#x2019;s mumbling to himself as he turns on his TV and waits for the chapter selection to appear on the screen. &#x201c;Saloon door . . . I&#x2019;m a man of the law but that don&#x2019;t make me honest . . . Round these parts . . . Yes!&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;s found the scene, and we all squeeze onto my parents&#x2019; old sofa, me in the middle acting as a buffer for the sexual tension between my brother and my best friend.</p><p>Toby presses play and turns up the volume. I recognize it as The Strangers, but I&#x2019;ve only seen it a couple times so I&#x2019;ve forgotten a lot of what&#x2019;s happening. The scene begins with a shot of a saloon door. We hear the voices of the people inside but the camera doesn&#x2019;t turn to them. When one person matters so much, all you can do is wait for his arrival. And then boots appear at the bottom of the door, a hat above it. The doors burst open and there stands Clyde Jones.</p><p>The screen fills with a close-up of his young, knowing face, shaded by a cowboy hat. He scans the saloon until he sees the sheriff, drinking at a table with one of the bad guys. The camera shifts to his cowb...</p></p><h2>The Parables of Jesus Coloring Book Devotional</h2><p><b>Worship with art as you color-in 46 stunning illustrations based on the parables of Jesus, each with a corresponding devotion and prompts for spiritual reflection and artistic exercise.</b><br><br>God's creativity is everywhere.

In the past year she has been editing Vampyre Magazine. After publishing two books in psychology, <em>Engaging the Immediate </em>and <em>The Art of Learning</em>, she wrote <em>Prism of the Night: A Biography of Anne Rice.</em> At the same time she had a cover story in <em>Psychology Today</em> on our culture's fascination with vampires. She followed the biography with several guide books to Anne Rice's fictional worlds including <em>The Vampire Companion: The Official Guide to Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles</em> and <em>The Anne Rice Reader.</em> Her last book before <em>Piercing the Darkness</em> was a biography of Dean Koontz called <em>Dean Koontz: A Writer's Biography</em>. She has also written for <em>The New York Times Book Review, The Writer, The Horror Show, The Newark Star Ledger, The Trenton Times,</em> and <em>Publishers Weekly.</em> Ramsland has a master's degree in clinical psychology and a Ph.D. in philosophy. She has been a professor at Rutgers University, a therapist, and a psycho-educator specializing in the psyche's shadow side, and is currently at work on another master's degree--this one in forensic psychology. She lives in Princeton, NJ.The recent success of HBO's funeral home comedy Six Feet Under proves the power of the macabre over public imagination. "[A]mused, disturbed, and delighted by the range of human behavior surrounding the subject of death," Ramsland (Ghost, Forecasts, Aug. 20; etc.) undertook a pop-anthropological survey of "cemetery culture" by interviewing graveyard caretakers, "death-care" consultants, funeral directors, grave diggers, monument dealers and mortuary assistants. This rambling, anecdotal account traces burial traditions such as embalming, cremation (30% of all funerals), corpse preparation, restorative techniques, cadaver cosmetics and unconventional funerals like the one attended by the deceased's fellow nudists. At Houston's National Museum of Funeral History and the annual National Funeral Directors Association's convention, Ramsland, a Rutgers professor, learns about mortuary schools and entrepreneurial schemes like hologram tombstones, the $65,000 mummification procedure and cemetery kiosks with touch-screen biographies of the deceased. Along with instructions on gravestone rubbing, artistic grave markers and unusual epitaphs, the book introduces "taphophiles," who visit cemeteries as a hobby. The book's closing section recounts ghastly tales of ghouls, corpse abuse, necrophilia and people buried alive, and fascinating interviews with people who grew up in funeral homes. Although it's "the corpseless soul that inspires the most fear," those with weak stomachs might want to skip the graphic description of autopsy procedures, botched reinterments and adipocere ("body cheese").

Though his books are perfectly nonsensical and absurd in all the best ways, they leave you feeling strangely serene about the universe. Whether his books introduce us to muffin-eating polar bears (Larry), really old time-traveling men (Uncle Borgel), or 266-pound chickens (Henrietta from <i>The Hoboken Chicken Emergency</i>), they each reflect a polite world where people (and other species) basically respect each other--warts, multiple heads, foul smells (we're thinking of the Bloboform), and all. As luck would have it, four of Pinkwater's previously published novels are now combined in one delicious and aptly named paperback volume, <i>4 Fantastic Novels</i>. In it you'll find <i>Borgel</i>, <i>Yobgorgle: Mystery Monster of Lake Ontario</i>, <i>The Worms of Kukumlima</i>, and <i>The Snarkout Boys and the Baconburg Horror</i>, none of which will disappoint. Fans will want to pick up <i>5 Novels</i> as well, a collection which includes <i>Alan Mendelsohn, the Boy from Mars</i>, <i>Slaves of Spiegel</i>, <i>The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death</i>, <i>The Last Guru</i>, and <i>Young Adult Novel</i>.<p> What are Pinkwater's novels like? Imagine the wondrous science fiction classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> without the heavy cosmos stuff--and seventy times funnier. (In <i>Borgel</i>, for example, 111-year-old Uncle Borgel compares the concept of time to a map of the state of New Jersey and describes space as "sort of like a bagel, but an elliptical one, with poppy seeds.") His fast-paced and funny adventure stories are philosophical and moral, though undercut with such delightfully irreverent goofiness that they never lose their buoyancy, not for a second. Pinkwater reaches out to the kids all over the planet who feel like "the boy from Mars," and shows them that everything is not only going to be just fine, but that life is pretty darn magical.

Critics accused her of distracting Gustav Mahler from his work, and her passionate love affairs shocked her peers. Drawing on Alma's vivid, sensual, and overlooked diaries, biographer Cate Haste recounts the untold and far more sympathetic story of this ambitious and talented woman. Though she dreamed of being the first woman to compose a famous opera, Alma was stifled by traditional social values. Eventually, she put her own dreams aside and wielded power and influence the only way she could, by supporting the art of more famous men. She worked alongside them and gained credit as their muse, commanding their love and demanding their respect. <br> <i>Passionate Spirit </i>restores vibrant humanity to a woman time turned into a caricature, providing an important correction to a history where systemic sexism has long erased women of talent. <br></p><p><b>Cate Haste</b> is a biographer, historian, and filmmaker.

Mahler is depicted as a woman who not only facilitated the creative pursuits of her husbands and lovers, but was an intellectual and creative force in her own right."&#x2015;<b>Hannah Beckerman</b>, <b><i><strong><em>The Guardian </em></strong></i></b><br><br>"Considering the sexism of the 19th and 20th centuries, Alma Mahler's status as a 'muse' can be understood as a strategic attempt to signal her own talents to the world. Haste presents a necessary update and reframing of Mahler's life and legacy."&#x2015;<b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>"Haste... gives Alma room to romp, drawing on unpublished diary entries and memoirs (along with a trove of previous accounts) to reveal the full Alma in all her maddening, intoxicating, intimidating variety.... This delectable biography assembles the awesome elements of Alma's breathtaking life's work; it answers the questions of who, where, and when; yet the question of <em>how</em> this one woman succeeded in filling her canvas so magisterially remains as tantalizing and mysterious as Alma herself."&#x2015;<b>Liesl Schillinger</b>, <b><i>Airmail</i></b><br><br>"What does it mean to be a muse who is looking for her own?

Lewis &amp; Francis Schaeffer: Lessons for a New Century from the Most Influential Apologists of Our Time</h2><p>In some ways, they could not be more different: the pipe-smoking, Anglican Oxford don and the blue-collar scion of conservative Presbyterianism. But C. S. Lewis and Francis Schaeffer, each in his unique way, fashioned Christian apologetics that influenced millions in their lifetimes. And the work of each continues to be read and studied today. In this book Scott Burson and Jerry Walls compare and contrast for the first time the thought of Lewis and Schaeffer. With great respect for the legacy of each man, but with critical insight as well, they suggest strengths and weaknesses of their apologetics. All the while they consider what Lewis and Schaeffer still have to offer in light of postmodernism and other cultural currents that, since their deaths, have changed the apologetic landscape. This incisive book stands as both an excellent introduction to the work of these two important figures and a fresh proposal for apologetics at the dawn of a new century.</p><p>Scott R. Burson is assistant professor of religion at Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana. Formerly, he served as director of communications at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky. Burson has had articles published in several periodicals, including <em>The Lamp-Post of the Southern California C. S. Lewis Society.</em><br><br>Jerry L. Walls is professor of philosophy of religion at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky. His annual C. S. Lewis seminar is one of the school's most popular offerings. He is also author of <em>Hell: The Logic of Damnation.</em>"Apologetics can create a climate for faith. Standing on the shoulders of giants like these, we can learn to tell the Story ever more beautifully and effectively." (Clark H. Pinnock)<br><br>"Burson and Walls offer students of Lewis and Schaeffer a rare treat: fresh insights into the commonalities and dissonances between these influential thinkers, climaxed by a compelling, holistic agenda for apologetics in the next millennium." (Bruce L. Edwards, author of A Rhetoric of Reading: C. S. Lewis's Defense of Western Literacy)<br><br>"This is a first-rate study of Schaeffer and Lewis. It is also a splendid exploration of the issues they sought to identify and explore. Fans of Schaeffer and Lewis will be challenged to enrich what they have already found; newcomers will be drawn into a conversation of striking clarity and depth." (William J. Abraham, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University)</p><h2>The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad Book I: Discover the Ancient Scriptures of God&#39;s Love For You</h2><p>&#34;Eckankar...its simplicity, once grasped, is staggering to the intellect.&#34; The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad means &#34;Way of the Eternal.&#34; These writings are the scriptures of Eckankar, Religion of the Light and Sound of God.

Speaking of Szeemann on the occasion of this legendary curator's death in 2005, critic Aaron Schuster summed up, "the image we have of the curator today: the curator-as-artist, a roaming, freelance designer of exhibitions, or in his own witty formulation, a 'spiritual guest worker'... If artists since Marcel Duchamp have affirmed selection and arrangement as legitimate artistic strategies, was it not simply a matter of time before curatorial practice--itself defined by selection and arrangement--would come to be seen as an art that operates on the field of art itself?"</p><p></p><h2>Metropolitan Fetish: African Sculpture and the Imperial French Invention of Primitive Art</h2><p><p>From the 1880s to 1940, French colonial officials, businessmen and soldiers, returning from overseas postings, brought home wooden masks and figures from Africa. This imperial and cultural power-play is the jumping-off point for a story that travels from sub-Saharan Africa to Parisian art galleries; from the pages of fashion magazines, through the doors of the Louvre, to world fairs and international auction rooms; into the apartments of avant-garde critics and poets; to the streets of Harlem, and then full-circle back to colonial museums and schools in Dakar, Bamako, and Abidjan. </p><p>John Warne Monroe guides us on this journey, one that goes far beyond the world of Picasso, Matisse, and Braque, to show how the Modernist avant-garde and the European colonial project influenced each other in profound and unexpected ways. <i>Metropolitan Fetish </i>reveals the complex trajectory of African material culture in the West and provides a map of that passage, tracing the interaction of cultural and imperial power. A broad and far-reaching history of the French reception of African art, it brings to life an era in which the aesthetic category of "primitive art" was invented.</p></p><p>John Warne Monroe is Associate Professor of History at Iowa State University. He is the winner of Yale University&#39;s Theron Rockwell Field Prize.<p>"While traditional African art continues to capture new audiences, John Monroe tells the fascinating story of how it all began.

Highly recommended!"</p> (Bruno Claessens, European Director of African Art, Christie's)<br><br><p>"This is a profoundly important book.

Steiner, author of <i>African Art in Transit</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Metropolitan Fetish</i>&nbsp;is a truly excellent book: ambitious in reach, rich in detail, and masterfully narrated. By establishing the complex commercial, colonial, and intellectual networks that made possible the revaluation of African sculpture, Monroe transforms our understanding of the French infatuation with black culture as a key marker of imperial modernity."</p> (Alice L.

P. Cavafy&#x2014;including the first English translation of the poet&#x2019;s final Unfinished Poems&#x2014;now published in one handsome edition and featuring the fullest literary commentaries available in English, by the renowned critic, scholar, and international best-selling author of <i>The Lost.</i><br> No modern poet so vividly brought to life the history and culture of Mediterranean antiquity; no writer dared break, with such taut energy, the early-twentieth-century taboos surrounding homoerotic desire; no poet before or since has so gracefully melded elegy and irony as the Alexandrian Greek poet Constantine Cavafy (1863&#x2013;1933). Whether advising Odysseus on his return to Ithaca or confronting the poet with the ghosts of his youth, these verses brilliantly make the historical personal&#x2014;and vice versa. To his profound exploration of longing and loneliness, fate and loss, memory and identity, Cavafy brings the historian&#x2019;s assessing eye along with the poet&#x2019;s compassionate heart. <br> After more than a decade of work and study, Mendelsohn&#x2014;a classicist who alone among Cavafy&#x2019;s translators shares the poet&#x2019;s deep intimacy with the ancient world&#x2014;gives readers full access to the genius of Cavafy&#x2019;s verse: the sensuous rhymes, rich assonances, and strong rhythms of the original Greek that have eluded previous translators. Complete with the Unfinished Poems that Cavafy left in drafts when he died&#x2014;a remarkable, hitherto unknown discovery that remained in the Cavafy Archive in Athens for decades&#x2014;and with an in-depth introduction and a helpful commentary that situates each work in a rich historical, literary, and biographical context, this revelatory translation is a cause for celebration: the definitive presentation of Cavafy in English.</p><p>Daniel Mendelsohn was born on Long Island and studied classics at the University of Virginia and at Princeton. His reviews and essays on literary and cultural subjects appear frequently in <i>The New Yorker </i>and <i>The New York Review of Books. </i>His books include a memoir, <i>The Elusive Embrace, </i>a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book and a <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Best Book of the Year; the international best seller <i>The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million; </i>and a collection of essays, <i>How Beautiful It Is and How Easily It Can Be Broken</i>. He teaches at Bard College.&#x201c;Extraordinary.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dan Chiasson, <i>The New Yorker</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Cavafy&#x2019;s distinctive tone&#x2014;wistfully elegiac but resolutely dry-eyed&#x2014;has captivated English-language poets from W. H. Auden to James Merrill to Louise Gl�ck. . . . Mendelsohn&#x2019;s new translations not only bring us closer to one of the great poets of the twentieth century; [they] also reinvigorate our relationship to the English language . . . Like Richard Howard&#x2019;s Baudelaire or Robert Pinsky&#x2019;s Dante, Mendelsohn&#x2019;s Cavafy is itself a work of art.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Brilliant . . . With his passionate reading of this poet-historian . . . Mendelsohn has created not only an essential guide to Cavafy for English-speaking readers, but has likely shaped our understanding of the greatest writer of modern Greek for generations to come.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Boston Review</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Eloquent . . . [This is] the Cavafy of a brilliant critic who has a true and deep affinity for the poet&#x2014;and who has succeeded in giving him to us whole for the first time.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Nation</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Thrilling . . . Mendelsohn is such a felicitous interpreter of Cavafy . . . The explanatory essays he has attached to almost every poem can contain every bit as much passion and humanity as the poet&#x2019;s own work.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Superb . . . Mendelsohn&#x2019;s translations are not only skillful, but elegant; best of all, they catch the music of the originals.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New Criterion</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A vigorous labor of literary love . . . The poems fully embody Cavafy the sensualist and the antiquarian and his distinctive lyric shuttling between the ancient and the modern worlds.&#x201d; &#x2014;Billy Collins<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With deep feeling, exacting care, and extraordinary intelligence, Mendelsohn has given us a stunning new Cavafy . . . All of us who care about literature are indebted to Mendelsohn for bringing forward a splendid addition to our understanding of a poet whose work is lit by bright starry sparks of the eternal.&#x201d; &#x2014;Edward Hirsch</p><h2>Lonely Planet Florida 8 (Regional Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet</i></b> <b><i>Florida</i> </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Not even the truth.<br></b>Deborah Monroe and her daughter, Grace, are driving home from a party when their car hits a man running in the dark. Grace was at the wheel, but Deborah sends her home before the police arrive, determined to shoulder the blame for the accident. Her decision then turns into a deception that takes on a life of its own and threatens the special bond between mother and daughter.<br> <br><i>The Secret Between Us</i> is an unforgettable story about making bad choices for the right reasons and the terrible consequences of a lie gone wrong. Once again, Barbara Delinksy has delivered a riveting study of family and a superbly crafted novel, perfectly targeted to reading groups and fans of provocative fiction.</p><p><b>Barbara Delinsky is the author of more than seventeen bestselling novels with over twenty million copies in print. She has been published in twenty-five languages worldwide. Barbara lives with her family in New England.</b><b>Chapter 1</b><br>They were arguing in the seconds before impact. Later, Deborah Monroe would agonize about that, wondering whether, had she been focused solely on the road, she might have seen something sooner and been able to prevent what occurred&#x2014;because the argument had been nearly as distracting as the storm. She and her daughter never argued. They were similar in looks, temperament, and interests. Deborah rarely had to tweak Grace&#x2014;her son, Dylan, yes, but not Grace. Grace usually understood what was expected and why.<br><br>This night, though, the girl fought back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting hyper about nothing, Mom. Nothing happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You said Megan&#x2019;s parents were going to be home,&#x201d; Deborah reminded her.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Megan told me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would have thought twice if I&#x2019;d known there would be a crowd.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were <i>studying</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You, Megan, and Stephie,&#x201d; Deborah said, and, yes, the textbooks were there, damp from Grace&#x2019;s dash to the car in the rain, &#x201c;plus Becca, and Michael, Ryan, Justin, and Kyle, none of whom were supposed to be there. Three girls study. Four girls and four boys make a party. Sweetie, it&#x2019;s pouring rain, and even above the noise of that, I could hear shrieking laughter all the way from the car.&#x201d;<br><br>Deborah didn&#x2019;t know if Grace was looking guilty. Long brown curls hid broad&#x2013;set eyes, a straight nose, and a full upper lip. She did hear the snap of her daughter&#x2019;s gum; its spearmint shrouded the smell of wet books. But she quickly returned her own eyes to the road, or what she could see of it, despite the wipers working double time. Visibility on this stretch was poor even on the best of nights. There were no streetlights, and moonshine rarely penetrated the trees.<br><br>Tonight the road was a funnel. Rain rushed at them, swallowing the beam of the headlights and thrashing against the windshield&#x2014;and yes, April meant rain, but this was absurd. Had it been as bad on the way out, Deborah would never have let Grace drive home. But Grace had asked, and Deborah&#x2019;s husband&#x2014;ex&#x2013;husband&#x2014;too often accused her of being overprotective.<br><br>They were going slowly enough; Deborah would repeat that many times in subsequent days, and forensics would bear it out. They were less than a minute from home and knew this part of the road well. But the darkness was dense, the rain an unreckoned force. Yes, Deborah knew that her daughter had to actually drive in order to learn how, but she feared this was too much, too soon.<br>Deborah hated rain. Grace didn&#x2019;t seem fazed.<br><br>&#x201c;We finished studying,&#x201d; the girl argued around the gum in her mouth. Her hands were tight on the wheel, perfectly positioned, nothing wrong there. &#x201c;It was hot inside, and the AC wasn&#x2019;t on yet, so we opened the windows. We were taking a break. Like, is it a crime to laugh? I mean, it&#x2019;s bad enough my mother had to come to get me&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Deborah cut in, &#x201c;but what was the alternative? You can&#x2019;t drive by yourself on a learner&#x2019;s permit. Ryan and Kyle may have their licenses, but, by law, they&#x2019;re not allowed to take friends in the car without an adult, and besides, we live on the opposite end of town from the others&#x2014;and what&#x2019;s so bad about your mother picking you up at ten o&#x2019;clock on a weeknight? Sweetie, you&#x2019;re barely sixteen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Exactly</i>,&#x201d; Grace said with feeling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sixteen, Mom. I&#x2019;ll have my real license in four months. So what&#x2019;ll happen then? I'll be driving myself places all the time&#x2014;because we don&#x2019;t only live on the opposite end of town from everyone else, we live in the middle of <i>nowhere</i>, because Dad decided he had to buy a <i>gazillion</i> acres to build a McMansion in the forest, which he then decided he didn&#x2019;t <i>want</i>, so he left it <i>and</i> us and moved to Vermont to live with his long&#x2013;lost love from twenty&#x2013;five years ago&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grace&#x2013;&#x201d; Deborah couldn't go there just then. Grace might feel abandoned by her father, but the loss hit Deborah harder. Her marriage wasn&#x2019;t supposed to end. That hadn&#x2019;t been in the plan.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, forget Dad,&#x201d; Grace went on, &#x201c;but once I get my license, I&#x2019;ll be driving places alone, and you won&#x2019;t see who&#x2019;s there or whether there&#x2019;s a parent around, or whether we&#x2019;re studying or having a party. You&#x2019;re going to have to <i>trust</i> me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do trust you,&#x201d; Deborah said, defensive herself now, but pleading. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the others I don&#x2019;t trust. Weren&#x2019;t you the one who told me Kyle brought a six&#x2013;pack to the pool party at Katherine&#x2019;s house last weekend?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None of us had any. Katherine&#x2019;s parents made him leave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Katherine&#x2019;s <i>parents</i>.<i> Exactly</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>Deborah heard her growl. &#x201c;Mom. We were studying.&#x201d;<br><br>Deborah was about to list the things that could happen when teenagers were studying&#x2014;things she had seen both growing up, when her father was the only family doctor in town, and now, being in practice with him and treating dozens of local teenagers&#x2014;when a flash of movement entered her line of sight on the right. In quick succession came the jolt of a weighty thud against the front of the car, the slam of brakes, the squeal of tires. Her seat belt tightened, holding her while the car skidded on the flooded pavement, fishtailed, and spun, all in the space of seconds. When it came to a stop, they were facing backward.<br><br>For a minute, Deborah didn&#x2019;t hear the rain over the thunder of her heart. Then, above it, came Grace&#x2019;s frightened cry. &#x201c;<i>What was that?</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>What was that?</i>&#x201d; the girl repeated, her voice shaking this time.<br><br>Deborah was starting to shake, too, but her daughter was upright, belted in, clearly okay. Scrabbling to release her seat belt, Deborah hiked up the hood of her slicker and ran out to search for whatever it was they had hit. The headlights reflected off the wet road, but beyond that paltry light, it was totally dark.<br><br>Ducking back into the car, she fumbled through the glove box for a flashlight. Outside again, she searched the roadside, but saw nothing that remotely resembled a downed animal.<br><br>Grace materialized at her elbow. "Was it a <i>deer</i>?" she asked, sounding terrified.<br><br>Deborah's heart continued to pound. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Sweetie, get back in the car. You don&#x2019;t have a jacket.&#x201d; It was a warm enough spring night; she just didn&#x2019;t want Grace seeing what they had hit.<br><br>&#x201c;It <i>had</i> to be a deer,&#x201d; Grace cried, &#x201c;not even hurt, just ran off into the woods&#x2014;what else could it be?&#x201d;<br><br>Deborah didn&#x2019;t think a deer wore a running suit with a stripe up the side, which was what she swore she had seen in the split second prior to impact. A running suit meant something human.<br><br>She walked along the edge of the road, searching the low shrubs with her light. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she called out to whoever was there, &#x201c;are you hurt? Hello? Let me know where you are!&#x201d;<br><br>Grace hovered at her shoulder. &#x201c;Like, it came from <i>nowhere</i>, Mom&#x2014;no <i>person</i> would be out here in the rain, so maybe it was a fox or a raccoon&#x2014;or a deer, it <i>had</i> to be a deer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get back in the car, Grace,&#x201d; Deborah repeated. The words were barely out when she heard something, and it wasn't the idling car. Nor was it the whine of wind in the trees or the rain splattering everything in sight.<br><br>The sound came again, definitely a moan. She followed it to a point at the side of the road and searched again, but it was another minute before she found its source. The running shoe was barely visible in the wet undergrowth some four feet from the pavement, and the black pants rising from it, half hidden under a low branch of a hemlock, had a blue stripe. A second leg was bent in an odd angle&#x2014;broken, she guessed&#x2014;and the rest of him was crumpled against the base of a tree.<br><br>Supine, he ran no risk of suffocation in the forest undergrowth, but his eyes were closed. Short dark hair was plastered to his forehead. Scrambling through a clump of wet ferns, Deborah directed her flashlight to his head, but didn&#x2019;t see any blood other than that from a mean scrape on his jaw.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Omigod!</i>&#x201d; Grace wailed.<br><br>Deborah felt for a pulse at his neck. It was only when she found it that her own began beating again. &#x201c;Can you hear me?&#x201d; she asked, leaning close. &#x201c;Open your eyes for me.&#x201d; He didn't respond.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Omigod!</i>&#x201d; Grace cried hysterically. &#x201c;Do you know who that is, it&#x2019;s my history teacher!&#x201d;<br><br>Trying to think quickly, Deborah pulled her daughter back onto the road and toward the car. She could feel the girl trembling. As calmly as she could, Deborah said, &#x201c;I want you to run home, honey. It isn&#x2019;t more than half a mile, and you&#x2019;re already soaked. Dylan&#x2019;s alone. He&#x2019;ll be scared.&#x201d; She imagined a small face at the pantry window, eyes large, frightened, and magnified behind thick Harry Potter glasses.<br><br>&#x201c;What'll <i>you</i> do?&#x201d; Grace asked in a high, wavery voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Call the police, then sit with Mr. McKenna until an ambulance comes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see him, I swear, I didn&#x2019;t see him,&#x201d; wailed Grace. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you do something for him, Mom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not much.&#x201d; Deborah turned off the engine, turned on the hazards. &#x201c;I don't see any profuse bleeding, and I don&#x2019;t dare move him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will he <i>die</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>Deborah grabbed her phone. &#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t going fast. We couldn&#x2019;t have hit him that hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But he got way over there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He must have rolled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t moving.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He may have a concussion or be in shock.&#x201d; There were plenty of worse possibilities, most of which, unfortunately, she knew.<br><br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t I stay here with you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There's nothing you can do here. Go, sweetie.&#x201d; She cupped her daughter&#x2019;s cheek, frantic to spare her this, at least. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be home soon.&#x201d;<br><br>Grace&#x2019;s hair was drenched, separating into long, wet coils. Rain dripped from a gentle chin. Eyes wide, she spoke in a frightened rush. &#x201c;Did <i>you</i> see him, Mom? Like, why would <i>anybody</i> be walking on the road in the rain? I mean, it&#x2019;s dark, how could I <i>possibly </i>see him, and why didn&#x2019;t <i>he</i> see <i>us</i>? There are no other lights here.&#x201d;<br><br>Deborah punched in 9&#x2013;1&#x2013;1 with one hand and took Grace&#x2019;s arm with the other. &#x201c;<i>Go</i>, Grace. I need you home with Dylan. <i>Now</i>.&#x201d; The dispatcher picked up after a single ring. Deborah knew the voice. Carla McKay was a patient of hers. She worked as the civilian dispatcher several nights a week.<br><br>&#x201c;Leyland Police. This call is being recorded.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Carla, it&#x2019;s Dr. Monroe,&#x201d; she said and shooed Grace off with a hand. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been an accident. I&#x2019;m on the rim road, maybe a half mile east of my house. My car hit a man. We need an ambulance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How badly is he hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s unconscious, but he&#x2019;s breathing. I&#x2019;d say there's a broken leg, but I&#x2019;m not sure what else. The only cut I see is superficial, but I can&#x2019;t look more without moving him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is anyone else hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. How fast can you get someone here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call now.&#x201d;<br><br>Deborah closed the phone. Grace hadn&#x2019;t moved. Soaking wet, curls long and bedraggled, she looked very young and frightened.<br><br>Frightened herself, Deborah stroked wet hair back from her daughter&#x2019;s cheeks. On a note of quiet urgency, she said, &#x201c;Grace, I need you home with Dylan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was driving.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be more of a help to me if you&#x2019;re with Dylan. Please, sweetie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was my fault.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Grace</i>. Can we <i>not</i> argue about this? Here, take my jacket.&#x201d; She was starting to slip it off when the girl turned and broke into a run. In no time, she had disappeared in the rain.<br><br>Pulling her hood up again, Deborah hurried back into the woods. The smell of wet earth and hemlock permeated the air, but she knew what blood smelled like and imagined that, too. Again, she looked for something beyond the scrape on Calvin McKenna&#x2019;s jaw. She saw nothing.<br><br>He remained unconscious, but his pulse was strong. She could monitor that and, if it faltered, could manually pump his chest. Studying the angle of his leg, she suspected that his injury involved the hip, but a hip injury was doable. A spine injury was something else, which was why she wouldn&#x2019;t move him. The EMTs would have a backboard and head immobilizer. Far better to wait.<br><br>It was easier said than done. It was an endless ten minutes of blaming herself for letting Grace drive, of taking Calvin McKenna's pulse, trying to see what else might be hurt, wondering what had possessed him to be out in the rain, taking his pulse again, cursing the location of their house and the irresponsibility of her ex&#x2013;husband, before she saw the flashing lights of the cruiser. There was no siren. They were in too rural a part of town for that.<br><br>Waving her flashlight, she ran back onto the road and was at the cruiser&#x2019;s door when Brian Duffy stepped out. In his mid&#x2013;forties, he was one of a dozen officers on the town force. He also coached Little League. Her son, Dylan, had been on his team for two years.<br><br>"Are you all right, Dr. Monroe?" he asked, fitting a plastic&#x2013;covered cap over his crewcut. He was already wearing a rain jacket.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. But my car hit Calvin McKenna.&#x201d; She led him back to the woods. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell how badly he&#x2019;s hurt.&#x201d; Once over the ferns, she knelt and checked his pulse again. It remained steady. She directed her flashlight at his face; its beam was joined by the officer&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;Cal?&#x201d; she called futilely. &#x201c;Cal? Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What was he doing out here?&#x201d; the officer asked.<br><br>Deborah sat back on her heels. &#x201c;I have no idea. Walking? Running?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the rain? That&#x2019;s strange.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Particularly here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you know where he lives?&#x201d; It certainly wasn&#x2019;t nearby. There were four houses in the circle of a mile, and she knew the residents of each.<br><br>&#x201c;He and his wife have a place over by the train station,&#x201d; Brian replied. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a few miles from here.

That&#x2019;s about all I know.&#x201d; She was reaching for his pulse again when the road came alive with light. A second cruiser arrived, its roof bar thrumming a raucous blue and white. An ambulance was close behind.<br><br>Deborah didn&#x2019;t immediately recognize the EMTs; they were young, likely new. But she did know the man who emerged from the second cruiser. John Colby was the police chief. In his late&#x2013;fifties, he would have been retired had he been working anywhere else, but he had grown up in Leyland. It was understood that he would keep working as long as his health allowed. Deborah guessed that would be a while. He and his wife were patients of theirs. His wife had a problem with allergens&#x2013;dander, pollen, dust&#x2014;that had resulted in adult&#x2013;onset asthma, but John&#x2019;s greatest problem, beyond a pot belly, was insomnia. He worked days; he worked nights. He claimed that being active kept his blood pressure down, and since his blood pressure was chronically low, Deborah couldn&#x2019;t argue.</p><h2>Yuki and the One Thousand Carriers (Tales of the World)</h2><p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Japanese provincial governors had to travel between the cities of Kyoto and Edo (modern-day Tokyo). This 300+ mile journey on the historic Tokaido Road required the presence of one to three thousand attendants (carriers). Yuki&#39;s father has been called to Edo and she, along with her mother and pet dog, must accompany him in this royal procession. Yuki does not want to go. She will miss her home and her teacher. But she must not be disrespectful so Yuki captures her thoughts in haiku, a Japanese form of poetry. Once outside the gate How will I find my way back? Will home disappear?

Her books with Sleeping Bear Press include The Listeners, Friend on Freedom River, and Jam and Jelly with Holly and Nellie. She lives in Michigan.Grade 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;An author's note explains that in 17th- and 18th-century Japan, provincial governors were required to divide their time between Kyoto, home of the Emperor, and Edo (modern Tokyo), where the Shogun exercised temporal power. Accompanied by numerous retainers, these feudal lords frequently traveled the 300-mile Tokaido Road, stopping at inns and teahouses built to accommodate their retinue. A famous series of woodcuts by Japanese printmaker Utagawa Hiroshige, depicting the landscapes they traversed, inspired Whelan to imagine this journey as seen through the eyes of Yuki, a governor's young daughter, who travels with her mother and small dog. Their party, with its 1000 carriers, passes over a river, through snowy mountains, and beside the ocean, where Mt. Fuji rises in the distance. Yuki describes the sights she sees through the shuttered windows of her <i>palanquin</i>, as well as the food and accommodations along the way. The haiku she writes at the request of her teacher are interspersed throughout the first-person narrative. These brief poems chart her homesickness and eventual acceptance of change. The handsome, well-composed watercolor illustrations, executed in subtle shades and reminiscent of Japanese woodcuts, lend specificity to the tale. A useful supplement to curriculums focusing on Japan.&#x2014;<i>Margaret A.

Their epic campaign&#x2014;revolving around the size and scope of government, its taxing power, and a nation awash in debt&#x2014;is America in microcosm. (It&#x2019;s also frighteningly relevant to our twenty-first-century democracy.) It is a fascinating story, told here by a gifted young historian, as promising as his protagonists.

A legendary figure in history, Vidocq is known as the first detective and an inspiration to great writers such as Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo and Edgar Allen Poe. As a player in the criminal underworld, Vidocq is a master of disguises and an accomplished thief, eventually turning his unlawful talents toward catching criminals as the first French chief of secret police. Playing both sides of the law, Vidocq&#x2019;s life highlights the blurry line between law enforcement and the criminals they pursue. Vidocq has a knack for finding trouble throughout his topsy-turvy life, getting into one hot situation after another, often finding himself behind bars, only to escape the first chance he gets. This book will take you on a whirlwind tour of 1830s France, including the circus stage, pirate ships, prison cells and beautiful women&#x2019;s boudoirs. Vidocq&#x2019;s life story is unforgettable and includes some of the best crime stories and juicy tales ever written.

Because of his success as the champion of the true traditional doctrine in mystical theology, he is acclaimed the precursor of the current movement toward the realization of mystical ideals. To forestall any criticism of Father Arintero&#39;s style and method of procedure, let it be remembered that he looked upon the sublime truths of the supernatural life as one would gaze upon a precious stone, turning it this way and that to catch its full brilliance and luster. There may be some persons who will question the wisdom of including excerpts from the writings of modem mystics that as yet are unknown to most readers. Many of these souls were under the guidance of Father Arintero, and he saw in their experiences the perpetual vitality of the mystical power of the Church. He uses them, then, to show that the heights of the mystical life are by no means a relic of the past, but that there are souls even today who have scaled and are scaling the mount of perfection. I here express my deep gratitude to the Very Reverend Father Provincial of the Province of Spain, who gave permission for this English translation of La Evoluci6n Mistica; to the Very Reverend Father Peter O&#39;Brien, O.P., Provincial of the Province of St. Albert the Great, for his kindly interest and unfailing encouragement; to Father Vitalis Fueyo, O.P., of Avila, Spain, for his careful reading, and checking of the entire translation; and to the Very Reverend Father Sabino Lozano, O.P., of Salamanca, Spain, for his helpful advice.

Povinelli reflects on a set of ethical and normative claims about the governance of love, sociality, and the body that circulates in liberal settler colonies such as the United States and Australia. She boldly theorizes intimate relations as pivotal sites where liberal logics and aspirations absorbed through settler imperialism are manifest, where discourses of self-sovereignty, social constraint, and value converge.<p></p><p>For more than twenty years, Povinelli has traveled to the social worlds of indigenous men and women living at Belyuen, a small community in the Northern Territory of Australia. More recently she has moved across communities of alternative progressive queer movements in the United States, particularly those who identify as radical faeries. In this book she traces how liberal binary concepts of individual freedom and social constraint influence understandings of intimacy in these two worlds. At the same time, she describes alternative models of social relations within each group in order to highlight modes of intimacy that transcend a reductive choice between freedom and constraint.</p><p>Shifting focus away from identities toward the social matrices out of which identities and divisions emerge, Povinelli offers a framework for thinking through such issues as what counts as sexuality and which forms of intimate social relations result in the distribution of rights, recognition, and resources, and which do not. In <i>The Empire of Love</i> Povinelli calls for, and begins to formulate, a politics of &#x201c;thick life,&#x201d; a way of representing social life nuanced enough to meet the density and variation of actual social worlds.</p></p><p>&#34;What a brilliant book. Elizabeth A. Povinelli strives to make all the intellectual moves that need to be made today: connecting studies of sexuality to other phenomena that seem to be unrelated, thus opening out what gets to count as &#39;sexuality&#39;; thinking about sexuality in relation to liberal governance; and moving us beyond the binary opposition of freedom versus constraint. These arguments are refreshing as well as pressing for our times.&#34;-- Lisa Rofel, author of &#34;Desiring China&#34;<p>Elizabeth A.

Irving Harper is the most famous designer you have never heard of. Working as an associate at the office of George Nelson in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, Harper was responsible for such icons of midcentury design as the Marshmallow sofa, the Ball clock, and numerous Herman Miller textile designs. Harper&#x2019;s unrecognized contribution to this seminal era of design, and his incredible paper sculptures (made in his spare time to "relieve stress"), are presented for the first time in this book. An essay by design critic Julie Lasky introduces Harper&#x2019;s commercial design work, recognizable designs from graphics to domestic goods to furniture that are still coveted and appreciated today, designed for the offices of Raymond Loewy, George Nelson, and then his own studio Harper + George. The second part of the book documents Harper&#x2019;s extensive paper sculptures, which have never been exhibited. More than three hundred works fill Harper&#x2019;s house and barn in Rye, New York, where this array of fantastical people and animal sculptures was created from modest and inexpensive materials as diverse as spaghetti and toothpicks in addition to paper. Images of Harper&#x2019;s home, filled with furniture and objects of his own design as well as his paper sculptures, offer a rare glimpse into a Modern design enthusiast&#x2019;s paradise.Offering insight into an important era of American design as well as the prolific output of a creative mind, this book promises to be the first to recognize Irving Harper&#x2019;s contribution to the field and will appeal to fans of Modern design.</p><p>Michael Maharam is the CEO of Maharam, a recipient of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award for Design Patron, and the author of Maharam Agenda.

He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. He died in 1997 aged seventy one. &#39;The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower&#39; - Daily Mirror"Not even C.S.

He lives alone in the back room of his auto body shop on Baker Street in north Trenton, and he hasn&#x2019;t cut his hair in at least ten years. For all I know that was also the last time he washed it. He has a reputation for drinking too much and abusing women, and he has a hotdog with testicles tattooed on his forehead. I suppose it might be a penis, but it&#x2019;s not a very good tattoo, and I prefer to think it&#x2019;s a hotdog.<br> None of this would be any of my business, but a couple months ago Trenton&#x2019;s finest caught Virgil hijacking an eighteen--wheeler filled with cases of premium bourbon.

I was currently pulling surveillance on Larry Virgil&#x2019;s three--bay garage, hoping to catch him entering or exiting. I was with my wheelman, Lula. We&#x2019;d been sitting across from the garage for over two hours and my eyes were crossing out of boredom.<br> &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t going anywhere,&#x201d; I said to Lula. &#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t answering his phone, and there aren&#x2019;t any lights on in the building.&#x201d;<br> Lula is a former &#x2019;ho who Vinnie hired as a file clerk a while back. When files went digital he didn&#x2019;t have the guts to fire her, so now Lula shows up every day for work and pretty much does whatever she wants. Mostly she hangs with me.

I think this is mostly a compliment, right?<br> &#x201c;My personal opinion is that this loser skipped town,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like he got family here. And we&#x2019;re not lookin&#x2019; at someone with a active social life.

He fiddled with the lock and the gate swung open.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; Lula said, sticking her hand into her big bedazzled purse and rooting around in it looking for her gun. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s that punk--ass Larry Virgil. I told you he&#x2019;d be back. I got a gun in here somewhere. Hold on while I get my gun.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need guns,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not known for being armed. All we have to do is wait for him to get inside and then we&#x2019;ll sneak in and slap the cuffs on him.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I got it,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;I got my gun. Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; I said.<br> Too late. Lula was out from behind the wheel of her Firebird, running across the road, waving her gun and yelling, &#x201c;Bond enforcement!&#x201d;<br> Virgil went deer in the headlights for a moment, then bolted for the corner with Lula in pursuit. Even in the dark of night I could see that Lula was running flat--out in her spike--heeled Via Spigas. Her spandex miniskirt was up around her waist, and one of her basketball--sized boobs had popped out of her tank top.<br> &#x201c;Stop or I&#x2019;ll shoot you dead,&#x201d; Lula yelled at Virgil.<br> I was running behind Lula, trying to close in on her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare shoot him,&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;No shooting!&#x201d;<br> Virgil crossed the street and ran back toward the garage. He reached Lula&#x2019;s red Firebird, wrenched the door open, jumped in, and took off.<br> &#x201c;He got my Firebird!&#x201d; Lula shrieked. &#x201c;He got my baby! And my purse is in there too. I personally bedazzled that purse. It was one of a kind. And it got all my makeup in there.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Guess you left the key in the ignition,&#x201d; I said, gasping for air, coming alongside Lula.<br> &#x201c;And you told me not to shoot him,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;This is all your fault. If I put some holes in him this would never have happened.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call it in to the police,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not waiting for no police,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going after that punk--ass.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t catch him on foot.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going on foot. I&#x2019;m taking his truck.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Do you know how to drive a truck?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sure I know how to drive a truck,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s to know?&#x201d;<br> She got a foot onto the first step up to the cab but couldn&#x2019;t get any lift.<br> &#x201c;This here stupid thing is too high,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;Get your hand under my ass and give me a shove up.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not for all the tea in China,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;Then go around and pull me in.&#x201d;<br> I climbed into the cab from the passenger side, crawled over, and gave Lula a hand up.<br> &#x201c;This is a bad idea,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t a clue where he&#x2019;s headed. He&#x2019;s disappeared, and on top of that he probably stole this truck.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I know where he&#x2019;s going,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to the chop shop on Stark. He&#x2019;s gonna sell my Firebird off for pieces. That&#x2019;s what these creeps do. They got no respect for people&#x2019;s personal vehicles.&#x201d;<br> I took my cellphone out of my pocket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling it in.&#x201d;<br> Lula stared at the dash. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a awful lot of doohickeys here.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I thought you said you knew how to drive one of these.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just sayin&#x2019; this here&#x2019;s a fancy rig. It got a cup holder and everything.&#x201d; She looked down at the floor. &#x201c;It got a lot of pedals down there. What the heck is that big one?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the clutch pedal.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s all coming back to me. I used to drive my Uncle Jimmy&#x2019;s dump truck before I got established as a &#x2019;ho.&#x201d;<br> She planted a Via Spiga on the clutch pedal and shifted. &#x201c;Here goes nothing.&#x201d;<br> The truck lurched forward and ground through a gear.<br> &#x201c;That didn&#x2019;t sound good,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;It don&#x2019;t matter if we lose a gear or two on account of this baby got a lot of them.&#x201d;<br> We slowly drove down the street.<br> &#x201c;This here&#x2019;s a piece of cake,&#x201d; Lula said.<br> She turned a corner and took out a trash receptacle.<br> &#x201c;Uh, you might have cut that corner a little tight,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;Yeah, but did you see how smooth this beauty rolled over that garbage can? It&#x2019;s like driving a tank.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a red light at the cross street,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know how to stop, right?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I step on the brake.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, but will the big trailer behind us stop at the same time?&#x201d;<br> Lula looked down at the floor. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s all hooked together being that I only see one brake pedal.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The light! The road!&#x201d; I yelled.<br> Lula sailed through the intersection.<br> &#x201c;You just ran the light!&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;Oops,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;My bad. Good thing there weren&#x2019;t any cars there.&#x201d;<br> I caught flashing strobes in my side mirror. &#x201c;I think we have a cop behind us,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You should pull over.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll waste my time and I gotta get to the chop shop before they start on my Firebird. I&#x2019;ll outmaneuver the guy behind me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re driving a truck! You can&#x2019;t even turn a corner, much less outmaneuver someone.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Boy, you&#x2019;re getting cranky. Anyways, this could be a good thing. What we got here is a police escort. He&#x2019;ll come in handy when we get to Stark Street and we confront Larry Virgil. This is our lucky day.&#x201d;<br> The cop car zipped past us and came to a stop just before the next intersection, blocking our way. Two patrolmen got out, guns drawn.<br> &#x201c;Hit the brakes,&#x201d; I said to Lula. &#x201c;Hit the brakes!&#x201d;<br> Lula stomped on the brake pedal, and the rig slowed down but didn&#x2019;t stop. The patrolmen jumped out of the way, and Lula punted the patrol car halfway down the block before bringing the semi to a stop.<br> &#x201c;It don&#x2019;t exactly stop on a dime,&#x201d; Lula said.<br> One of the cops approached. I rolled the window down and grimaced. It was Eddie Gazarra. We went to school together, and now he was married to my cousin Shirley the Whiner.<br> &#x201c;Hey, Eddie,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh crap,&#x201d; Eddie said.<br> Lula leaned over and looked past me to Eddie. &#x201c;We gotta get going. That moron Larry Virgil stole my car and I gotta get to Stark Street before my baby&#x2019;s nothing but spare parts. So I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you could get your patrol car out of my way.&#x201d;<br> Eddie and I looked down the street at what was left of the patrol car. It wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere anytime soon.<br> &#x201c;Sorry about your car,&#x201d; I said to Eddie. &#x201c;Lula didn&#x2019;t totally have the hang of driving this thing.&#x201d;<br> Eddie&#x2019;s partner, Jimmy, was standing alongside him. Our paths had crossed on a couple occasions, but I didn&#x2019;t actually know him. He was hands on hips looking like he thought this was funny but was trying not to laugh out loud.<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to ask to see her license and registration,&#x201d; Jimmy said.<br> &#x201c;My license is in my purse which is in my car which has been stolen,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;And what you&#x2019;re doing here is impeding the progress of justice.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You know this truck was hijacked, right?&#x201d; Eddie asked me.<br> &#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Lula and I were staking out Virgil&#x2019;s garage, and he pulled up in this truck. One thing led to another and here we are.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Are we going to arrest them?&#x201d; Jimmy asked, still grinning.<br> &#x201c;No, we aren&#x2019;t going to arrest them,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;Her grandmother would make my life a living hell.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What do you want to do about the car?&#x201d; Jimmy asked Eddie.<br> &#x201c;Get a tow truck out here. And report the Firebird to dispatch.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s red,&#x201d; Lula told Jimmy. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s got a one--of--a--kind bedazzled purse in it.&#x201d;<br> I swung down out of the cab. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s okay with you I&#x2019;ll call for a ride.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You calling Morelli?&#x201d; Eddie asked.<br> Joe Morelli is a Trenton cop working crimes against persons. He&#x2019;s also my boyfriend.<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said to Eddie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll grab a ride in one of Ranger&#x2019;s patrol cars. And I can get him to check with the chop shop to make sure they don&#x2019;t take Lula&#x2019;s car apart.&#x201d;<br> Ranger is a former Special Forces operative turned businessman and security expert. He&#x2019;s six feet of perfectly toned muscle. He&#x2019;s my age, but he&#x2019;s ages beyond me in life experience and street smarts. His coloring and heritage are Latino. He&#x2019;s single and intends to stay that way. He owns Rangeman, an exclusive security firm housed in a stealth building in downtown Trenton.<br> &#x201c;Sounds like a plan,&#x201d; Eddie said. He hitched a thumb in Lula&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re taking her with you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s going to have to come in and file an accident report tomorrow. I imagine by then you&#x2019;ll have come up with an explanation.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah. I owe you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Eddie said, &#x201c;because I need a babysitter next Saturday.&#x201d;<br> I squelched a grimace. Eddie&#x2019;s kids were monsters. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; I told him.<br> I made a short call to Ranger and joined Lula and Eddie at the side of the truck.<br> &#x201c;This is a freezer truck,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;What do you suppose Larry Virgil was gonna do with it? You think he has a big--ass freezer in his garage? How was he gonna store all the frozen stuff until he could turn it around?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s empty,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe he already offloaded the ice cream somewhere.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;This was reported stolen by Bogart Ice Cream,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;The compressor is running, so it&#x2019;s probably still full of ice cream.&#x201d; He walked to the back door. &#x201c;No security seal. It&#x2019;s just padlocked.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I could shoot the padlock off,&#x201d; Lula said, &#x201c;and then we could see what we got in here.&#x201d;<br> Eddie cut his eyes to Lula.<br> &#x201c;That would be if I had a gun,&#x201d; Lula said, thinking twice about her offer since she didn&#x2019;t have a permit to carry concealed.<br> &#x201c;Hey, Jimmy,&#x201d; Eddie yelled. &#x201c;Look in the cab and see if you can find the key to the padlock for the back door.&#x201d;<br> Jimmy climbed into the cab and swung down with the key. Eddie took the key, opened the door to the freezer truck, and a body fell out. We all jumped back.<br> &#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; Jimmy said.<br> It was a chocolate--covered man, sprinkled with chopped pecans, totally frozen. Hard to tell if it was a real corpse or a solid chocolate novelty item.<br> We all looked down at it.<br> &#x201c;That better not be a dead person,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;On account of you know how I feel about dead people. I&#x2019;m not in favor of them.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Could just be a big popsicle,&#x201d; Jimmy said, toeing the chocolate guy.<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;It don&#x2019;t got no stick up its hoo--hoo.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Call it in,&#x201d; Eddie said to Jimmy. &#x201c;And tell them to get CSI out here before he melts.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Maybe we should put him back in the freezer truck,&#x201d; I said to Eddie.<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;I guess we could do that.&#x201d;<br> No one made a move to pick up the chocolate guy.<br> &#x201c;Or we could leave him here,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;That got my vote,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not touching him, in case he got the dead cooties.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Keep your eye on him,&#x201d; Eddie said to me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to see if I can get the trunk open on the squad car so I can get some crime scene tape and rubber gloves.&#x201d;<br> Lula looked into the trailer. &#x201c;They had him jammed up next to the back door,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;The rest of the truck is filled with cartons of Bogart <br> ice cream. Somebody&#x2019;s gonna be real disappointed in the morning if they don&#x2019;t get their ice cream delivery. Personally I&#x2019;m a Mo Morris ice cream person as opposed to a Bogart ice cream person. Not that I&#x2019;d turn my nose up at a carton of this here ice cream if it accidentally fell out of the truck.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That would be tampering with evidence,&#x201d; Jimmy said. <br> &#x201c;Just sayin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> Eddie returned with some yellow tape and a box of disposable gloves.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be willing to help,&#x201d; Lula said, &#x201c;but those gloves are the wrong size for me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re one--size--fits--all,&#x201d; Eddie said.<br> &#x201c;Nuh--uh,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t look good on me, and they&#x2019;d ruin my nail varnish.&#x201d;<br> A shiny black Porsche Cayenne drove up and eased to a stop, and Ranger got out. He was dressed in Rangeman black fatigues. He&#x2019;s the boss, but he still works alongside his men if the threat level is high or if they&#x2019;re short--handed. He walked over to me and looked down at the chocolate man.<br> &#x201c;Nice touch with the chopped nuts,&#x201d; Ranger said. &#x201c;Who is he?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go through his pockets and ruin the chocolate.&#x201d;<br> Eddie and Ranger pulled on rubber gloves, crammed the stiff back into the truck, and closed the door on him.<br> I got into the front of the Porsche with Ranger, and Lula got into the back. We drove to Stark Street in silence, and Ranger parked in front of the chop shop. A shiny black Rangeman Ford Explorer idled in the driveway. Lula&#x2019;s red Firebird was parked next to the Explorer. A Rangeman guy who looked like the Hulk except for the part about being green got out of the Explorer and walked over to us.<br> &#x201c;The Firebird was just dropped off,&#x201d; he said to Ranger, handing him the car keys. &#x201c;It seems to be undamaged. There&#x2019;s a purse in the backseat.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Any sign of Larry Virgil?&#x201d; Ranger...</p><h2>Missing in Malm�: The third Inspector Anita Sundstr�m mystery</h2><p><p>Praise for <i>Meet Me in Malmo</i>, the first in the series:</p><p>"Utterly compelling."&#x2014;Tony Black</p><p>"A superb crime saga with more to come."&#x2014;<i>The Crack</i></p><p>Third in a series of the best-selling crime mysteries featuring Inspector Anita Sundstrom.</p></p><p>Torquil MacLeod is an advertising copywriter and author.

But the influence of these four landmark ideas has extended far beyond hard science. There is no aspect of twentieth-century culture��including the arts, social sciences, philosophy, and politics��that has not been profoundly influenced by them.</p> <p>In <i>Great Ideas in Physics</i>, Alan Lightman clearly explains the physics behind each of the four great ideas and deftly untangles for lay readers such knotty concepts as entropy, the relativity of time, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Throughout the book he uses excerpts from the writings of scientific luminaries such as Newton, Kelvin, Einstein, and de Broglie to help place each in its proper historical perspective. And with the help of expertly annotated passages from the works of dozens of writers, philosophers, artists, and social theorists, Lightman explores the two-way influences of these landmark scientific concepts on our entire human culture and the world of ideas.</p></p><p><p><b>Alan Lightman, Ph.D.,</b> currently Senior Lecturer in Physics at M.I.T., received the Association of American Publishers Award for the best book in physical science for Origins.

The food is in essence Italian, but accented with exotic Mediterranean touches: pesto punched up with capers, gelato made with pistachios, pasta laced with saffron, and a penchant for sweet-and-sour preparations like caponata and strong flavors like wild fennel and oregano. Sicily tells the wonderful histories behind the classic dishes but also shows how contemporary chefs and home cooks are reinvigorating recipes in modern ways.<br> &nbsp;<br> The product of years of careful research, <i>Sicily </i>gives a tour of the land&#x2019;s culinary treasures, from the couscous of Lo Capo and the vines of Mt. Etna to the sea salt of Trapani and the black pigs of Mirto. The book gives foolproof instructions for all the cardinal dishes such as Arancini, Pasta with Sardines, and Swordfish Involtini, but there are also plenty of delicious contemporary recipes, such as Eggplant Parmigiana in a Glass, Butternut Squash Caponata, and Cannoli Millefoglie.

Concise and original, this engaging book is an antidote to the behemoth art history textbooks from which we were all taught. As he demonstrates so persuasively, there can never be one story of art. Cultures have their own stories - about themselves, about other cultures - and to hear them all is one way to hear the multiple stories that art tells. But each of us also has our own story of art, a kind of private art history made up of the pieces we have seen, and loved or hated, the effects they had on us, and the connections that might be drawn among them.</p> <p>Elkins opens up the questions that traditional art history usually avoids. What about all the art not produced in Western Europe or in the Europeanized Americas? Is it possible to include Asian art and Indian art in &#x2018;the story?&#x2019; What happens when one does? To help us find answers, he uses both Western and non-Western artworks, tables of contents from art histories written in cultures outside the centre of Western European tradition, and strangely wonderful diagrams of how artworks might connect through a single individual. True multiculturalism may be an impossibility, but art lovers can each create a &#x2018;story of art&#x2019; that is right for themselves.<br></p></p><p><strong>James Elkins</strong> is Professor of Art History at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He is the author of many books. Among is books are <em>Pictures and Tears, How to Use</em> <em>Your Eyes,</em> and <em>What Painting Is,</em> all published by Routledge.Intrepid, personable, and prolific art historian Elkins shifts his keen gaze from art to art history in this surefooted and amiable disquisition on how the story of art has been told, and why. Elkins assesses the standard text in the field, E. H. Gombrich's often revised <i>The Story of Art</i>, and the vision it promotes of art history as an orderly, chronological progression toward the pinnacle of art, "naturalistic skill," which the moderns then abandoned. Elkins dissects the many pitfalls of this simplistic approach, and envisions provocative alternatives, all the while musing on how to address the many tricky questions art historians confront, especially the challenge of how to integrate non-Western art into the story of Western art, and how to answer urgent questions about race, gender, sexuality, and even language itself. Elkins' smart, knowledgeable, original, and engaging multicultural analysis ultimately celebrates the ongoing conflict between art, which often seeks to defy categorization, and our desire for order and definition, all the while recognizing this irresolvable debate is a wellspring for fresh perspectives on the crucial and fascinating story of creative expression. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Stone walls are not simply monuments to the skill of Yankee farmers. The historical record makes clear that many were built by slaves, Indians, indentured servants, and children.

His books include <i>The New International Money Game</i>, (Palgrave Macmillan) now in its seventh edition, as well as the book <i>Your Money and Your Life.</i><p>'Underneath the hilarious anecdotes, the elegant epigrams, and the graceful turns of phrase, Kindleberger is deadly serious. The manner in which humans beings earn their livings is no laughing matter to him, especially when they attempt to do so at the expense of one another. As he so effectively demonstrates, manias, panics, and crashes are the consequence of an economic environment that cultivates cupidity, chicanery, and rapaciousness rather than a devout belief in the Golden Rule.' - From the Foreword to the Fourth Edition by Peter L. Bernstein, author of The Power of Gold</p> <p>'Deep knowledge and a pragmatic approach to financial history qualifies Robert Aliber to provide this desperately needed sixth edition of Charles Kindleberger's classic study of financial manias and crashes. It comes in the immediate aftermath of the biggest and most dangerous global financial crisis since the 1930s. But that, alas, was no isolated event. It was, instead, the culmination of four waves of crisis over 40 years. The latest crisis is most unlikely to be the last. It may even be the precursor of a still bigger crisis in the years ahead. Read. Learn. Weep.' -Martin Wolf, Financial Times</p> <p>'Alas, both the need for a book such as Manias, Panics and Crashes, and the coverage of its material, keep on increasing, almost exponentially. So much has happened in the last few years that this is now Bob Aliber's book, as much as, perhaps more, than Charles Kindleberger's. Aliber has enhanced the prior high standards that Kindleberger set. This is an easily accessible book, filled with fascinating historical vignettes, and one that everyone from the experts to newcomers to the field should read and would profit greatly by doing so.' - Charles Goodhart, London School of Economics, UK</p> <p>'Every so often financial markets fly off the rails of rationality.

The range of fairy tales stretches across great distances and time; their history is entangled with folklore and myth, and their inspiration draws on ideas about nature and the supernatural, imagination and fantasy, psychoanalysis and feminism. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Marina Warner digs into a rich hoard of fairy tales in all their brilliant and fantastical variations, in order to define a genre and evaluate a literary form that keeps shifting through time and history. Drawing on a glittering array of examples, from classics such as <em>Red Riding Hood</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, and <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em>, the Grimm Brothers' <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>, and Hans Andersen's <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, to modern-day realizations including Walt Disney's <em>Snow White</em>, Warner forms a persuasive case for fairy tale as a crucial repository of human understanding and culture. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions </em>series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

MacDonald documents the genesis of this new architecture by describing, analyzing, and evaluating four key monuments erected in Rome between A.D. 60 and 130: the palaces of Nero and Domitian, the first true palaces of Europe; Trajan&#x2019;s Markets (besides his Forum), a superb example of Rome&#x2019;s highly original social architecture; and the mighty Pantheon. Planned and constructed for the paramount city of the Empire, these building radically altered the history of design and construction. The essentially urban architecture they defined soon appeared in hundreds of prosperous cities and towns, evoking an imagery of Rome throughout its dominions and later carrying many Roman concepts of design into Mediterranean and European architecture.<br>The emphasis throughout is upon the direct testimony of the buildings as they stand today, and the text is augmented by many plans, reconstructions, and photographs. For the revised edition MacDonald has updated the bibliography and added a new chapter in which he reviews recent studies and continues to probe questions of style and significance that he raised earlier. This book stands as one of lasting value to architectural historians, archaeologists, and the classicists as well as to students of ancient history and culture.</p><p></p><h2>Nurse Practitioner Certification Examination And Practice Preparation</h2><p><strong>Start preparing for your future...today!</strong><br>Develop the test-taking skills you need to prepare for your certification examination and gain a solid knowledge base to successfully enter practice.<br>Begin with a real-world case study introducing must-know disorders; then quiz yourself with questions reflecting the content in the board certification examinations.

Using Aramco files never before available to scholars or journalists, dozens of personal interviews, and U.S. and British government documents, Anthony Cave Brown recounts the unceasing diplomatic and corporate maneuvers aimed at obtaining this unimaginable wealth, an ongoing drama that involved such figures as the great warrior-king Ibn Saud, founder of the Saudi dynasty; H. St. John Philby, the British scholar-adventurer who was a chief advisor to the king; the American philanthropist Charles Crane; Winston Churchill; Franklin Delano Roosevelt; and assorted oil-industry executives and engineers across the United States. Played out against a background of war and the turmoil of an ancient culture thrust abruptly into the twentieth century, the struggle to obtain the prize was won b</p><p>Anthony Cave Brown, the author of several well-received books on the history of espionage, here turns his attention to a story as full of intrigue as any spy novel: the rise of Aramco, once the world's leading oil concern. Led by a consortium of American investors, Aramco managed through considerable guile to insert itself in territory tightly controlled by the British--thanks, in part, to the labors of one H. St. John Philby, a British spy (and father of the notorious Soviet double agent Kim Philby) who held great influence in the court of Saudi king Ibn Saud, and who, writes Brown, "was to betray the British government in favor of Standard Oil." The Americans won Saudi favor not only through Philby, but also through an intrepid Chicago-born entrepreneur and diplomat named Charles Crane, who did for Ibn Saud what the British failed to do: Crane built a costly waterworks that brought drinking water into the Saudi interior. (For his part, Philby obtained the monopoly on selling Ford automobiles in the country. In six years, he sold the king 1,450 cars.) The result was a concession to the American concern to what the U.S. State Department once called "the most valuable commercial prize in the history of the planet," namely, the vast oil fields of Arabia; for an initial investment of �100,000, Aramco eventually extracted more than a trillion dollars from the Arabian reserves. The American interest in Saudi and Persian Gulf oil has remained strong ever since, Brown writes--he even calls the Gulf War of 1991 "the Aramco War"-- although the company was nationalized in the mid-1980s. Brown's careful research and vivid prose yield a fine read for anyone interested in contemporary affairs and world history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Anthony Cave Brown is the author of Treason in the Blood, On a feild of Red, Bodyguard of Lies, and biographies of Stewart Menzies and William S.

Edited by Tom Pomplun.The Graphic Classics series has been improving our cultural literacy by presenting zippy comics-styled renderings of those stories most people read in school, or at least know they should&#x2019;ve read. The formula works particularly well in this collection of 12 classic horror stories, which includes short works by Edgar Allan Poe, Ambrose Bierce, Jack London and Honor� de Balzac, among others. The book begins with a stylish depiction of Bierce&#x2019;s mummy as a cool cocktail-lounge character wearing a fez, before settling down to business with a very effective adaptation of Lovecraft&#x2019;s "The Thing on the Doorstep." The vivid black inks and woodcut style of illustrator Michael Manning enhance the original tale&#x2019;s creepiness. Poe&#x2019;s "Some Words with a Mummy," by contrast, is drawn in a cartoonish manner, with a touch of humor that suits this feather-light tale that&#x2019;s far more social commentary than spine tingler. Balzac&#x2019;s "The Thing at Ghent" is all style, with no words at all; those not already familiar with the work may be left in the dark by artist Mark Dancey&#x2019;s version. "The Monkey&#x2019;s Paw," however, illustrated by John W. Pierard, retains all the eerie detail of W. W. Jacob&#x2019;s original. Jack London&#x2019;s "Keesh, Son of Keesh," drawn by Ryan Inzana, is another moody work, while Bret Harte&#x2019;s "Selina Sedilia," admirably adapted by Antonella Caputo and rendered by Nick Miller, is as silly as it should be.

As Grant shows, Garvey was a man of contradictions: a self-educated, poetry-writing aesthete and unabashed propagandist, an admirer of Lenin, and a dandy given to elaborate public displays. Above all, he was a shrewd promoter whose use of pageantry evoked a lost African civilization and fired the imagination of his followers. <em>Negro With a Hat</em> restores Garvey to his place as one of the founders of black nationalism and a key figure of the 20th century.<br><br> <strong>"A searching, vivid, and (as the title suggests) complex account of Garvey's short but consequential life."</strong><br> --Steve Hahn, <em>The New Republic</em><br><br> "The story of Marcus Garvey, the charismatic and tireless black leader who had a meteoric rise and fall in the late 1910s and early '20s, makes for enthralling reading, and Garvey has found an engaging and objective biographer in Colin Grant....

In doing so, <i>Drag Race</i> became not only a repository of queer history and culture, but also an examination and illustration of queer life in the modern age.

Sutton</b>.</p></p><h2>Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover</h2><p>Lyric and sensual, D.H. Lawrence&#39;s last novel is one of the major works of fiction of the twentieth century. Filled with scenes of intimate beauty, explores the emotions of a lonely woman trapped in a sterile marriage and her growing love for the robust gamekeeper of her husband&#39;s estate. The most controversial of Lawrence&#39;s books, &#34;Lady Chatterly&#39;s Lover&#34; joyously affirms the author&#39;s vision of individual regeneration through sexual love. The book&#39;s power, complexity, and psychological intricacy make this a completely original work--a triumph of passion, an erotic celebration of life.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous of Lawrence's novels, the 1928 <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> is no longer distinguished for the once-shockingly explicit treatment of its subject matter--the adulterous affair between a sexually unfulfilled upper-class married woman and the game keeper who works for the estate owned by her wheelchaired husband. Now that we're used to reading about sex, and seeing it in the movies, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful and lyrical writer, whose story takes us bodily into the world of its characters.The Cambridge edition of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover is the first ever to restore to Lawrence&#39;s most famous novel the words that he wrote. Removing corruptions and errors and including hundreds of new words, phrases and sentences - this is the only text that can be read or quoted with confidence.</p><h2>The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Volume II: Since 1500</h2><p>Featuring a beautiful new design, THE EARTH AND ITS PEOPLES, Sixth Edition, presents world history in a balanced, global framework, shifting the focus away from political centers of power.

The CD-ROM also includes the pronunciation of each bold term found in the text. </p> <p><b>Chapter Organization</b></p> <p> Each chapter begins with a Professional Profile feature that gives you a brief glimpse into the training and duties of a specific health career. Every chapter also begins with learning objectives that present the chapter goals and an outline to give you a quick overview of the chapter's contents. </p> <p><b>Introductory Chapters</b></p> <p> Chapter 1 contains information necessary for an understanding of how medical terms are formed. This includes learning about word roots, combining forms, prefixes, and suffixes, and general rules for building medical terms. You will also learn about terminology for medical records and the different health care settings. In Chapter 2, you will learn about terminology relating to the body structure, including organs and body systems. Here you will first encounter a feature found in each remaining chapter, Word Building tables, which list medical terms and their respective word parts. Throughout each chapter are also Med Term Tips, which are intended to stimulate your interest by describing quick facts about medical terms. </p> <p><b>Anatomy and physiology Chapters</b></p> <p> Chapters 3 through 13 are organized by body system. Each chapter begins with an overview of the organs in the system and is followed by lists of combining forms, prefixes, and/or suffixes with their meanings. The anatomy and physiology section is divided into the various components of the system, and each subsection begins with a list of key medical terms. Key terms are boldfaced and accompanied by a pronounciation guide the first time they appear in the narrative. A Word Building table and medical terms with pronunciations follow each anatomy and physiology section. For ease of learning, the medical terms are divided into four separate sections: vocabulary, pathology, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic procedures. The new terms presented in the chapter are completed in a pharmacology and abbreviations section. The chapter review section includes a wide variety of exercises that both test your understanding and challenge you to apply the terms you have learned. </p> <p><b>Special Topics Chapter</b></p> <p> Chapter 14 contains timely information and appropriate medical terms relevant to the following medical specialties: pharmacology, mental health, diagnostic imaging, rehabilitation services, surgery, and oncology. Knowledge of these topics is necessary for the well-rounded health care worker. </p> <p><b>Appendices</b></p> <p> The appendices contain helpful reference lists of word parts and definitions. This information is intended for quick access. There are four main topics in the appendix: Abbreviations; Combining Forms; Prefixes; and Suffixes. The Combining Forms, Prefixes, and Suffixes Appendices present terms going from English to medical terms and then from medical terms to English. Finally, all of the key terms appear again in the glossary at the end of the text. </p> <p><b>To the Instructor</b></p> <p> The third edition of <b> <i>Medical Terminology: A Living Language</i></b><i> </i> uses an integrated approach for teaching medical terminology to the health care student.

Yet scientists are still learning a great deal because of photographs that either capture those processes in action or show us the critical factors left behind in the rock record.Volcanism by Hans-Ulrich Schmincke has photos of the best quality I have ever seen in a text on the subject. I found myself wishing that I had had the photo of Nicaragua&#x2019;s Masaya volcano, which was the subject of my dissertation, but it was Schmincke who was able to include it in his book. In addition, the schematic figures in their wide range of styles are clear, colorful, and simplified to emphasize the most important factors while including all significant features. The book&#x2019;s paper is of such high quality that at times I felt I had turned two pages rather than one.</em></p> <p><em>I have really enjoyed reading and rereading Schmincke&#x2019;s book. It fills a great gap in texts available for teaching any basic course in volcanology. No other book I know of has the depth and breadth of Volcanism. I was disappointed that the text did not arrive on my desk until last August, when it was too late for me to choose it for my course in volcanology. I am also disappointed about another fact&#x2015;the book&#x2019;s binding is already becoming tattered because of my intense use of it! </em></p> <p><em>Schmincke is a volcanologist who, in 1967, first published papers on sedimentary rocks of volcanic origin, the direction traveled by lava flows millions of years ago, and the structures preserved in explosive ignimbrites, or pumice-flow deposits, that reveal important details of their formation. Since then, his studies in Germany&#x2019;s Laacher See, the Canary Islands, the Troodos Ophiolite of Cyprus, and many other regions have forged great fundamental advances. Such contributions have been recognized with his receipt of several international awards and clearly give him a strong base for writing the book.</em></p> <p><em>However, as a scientist who has focused on the challenges of monitoring the very diverse activities of volcanoes, I think that the text&#x2019;s overriding emphasis on the rock record has its cost. The group of scientists who are struggling with their goals to reduce or mitigate the hazards of the eruptions of tomorrow need to learn more about the options of technology, instrumentation, and methodology that are currently available. More than 500 million people live near the more than 1500 known active volcanoes and are constantly facing serious threats of eruptions. An extremely energetic earthquake caused the horrific tsunamis of 2004. However, the tsunamis of 1792, 1815, and 1883, which were caused by the eruptions of Japan&#x2019;s Unzen volcano and Indonesia&#x2019;s Tambora and Krakatau volcanoes, each took a similar toll.

Unlike the "New Woman" novels of the era which challenged the idea that the unmarried woman was superfluous, Gissing satirizes that image and portrays women as "odd" and marginal in relation to an ideal. Set in a grimy, fog-ridden London, Gissing's "odd" women range from the idealistic, financially self-sufficient Mary Barfoot to the Madden sisters who struggle to subsist in low paying jobs and little chance for joy. With narrative detachment, Gissing portrays contemporary society's blatant ambivalence towards its own period of transition. Judged by contemporary critics to be as provocative as Zola and Ibsen, Gissing produced an "intensely modern" work as the issues it raises remain the subject of contemporary debate.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Integrating the work of Native peoples, it provides the first inclusive view of the artists who helped create an icon of the American wilderness by featuring painting, photography, basketry, and other artworks from both well-known and little-studied artists from the nineteenth century to the present. <i>Yosemite: Art of an American Icon </i>pursues several evocative themes, including the relationship between environment and aesthetics in Yosemite; the various ways in which artists have shaped how we see and use the park; and the dynamic intersections between art, nature, and commerce that have played out during its history. In addition to offering a wide-ranging view of Yosemite's art over the past two centuries, the volume provides intriguing insights into the complexities and contradictions inherent in its enduring image as both an unspoiled natural wonder and a must-see spot for sightseers.<br><br><i>With Essays by Amy Scott, William Deverell, Kate Nearpass Ogden, Gary F. Kurutz, Brian Bibby, Jennifer A. Watts, and Jonathan Spaulding </i><br><br><i>Copub: Museum of the American West</i></p><p>"For Americans of the nineteenth century, Yosemite, like Niagara Falls, offered a defining natural symbol of American possibilities. Here, in image and text, is the record of how the painters and photographers of that era-poised on California peaks in silent awe-celebrated the Yosemite as place and icon." Kevin Starr, Professor of History, University of Southern California<br><br> For 150 years Yosemite Valley has captured the American imagination through literary description, the photographer&#x2019;s lens, and the artist&#x2019;s palate. <i>Yosemite: Art of an American Icon</i> is a wonderful, multilayered cultural history of a spectacular American landscape. This is a story of the beauty of Nature melded with human perceptions, which tells us much about ourselves as well as the incomparable valley.&#x2019; It is a spectacular, entertaining read.&#x201d; Robert Righter, author of <i>The Battle over Hetch Hetchy </i><br><br>"Tracing the dynamic interconnections between art, nature, and commerce that transformed Yosemite into one of the most powerful and popular icons of wilderness in American culture, <i>Yosemite: Art of an American Icon</i> is a one-of-a-kind volume that graphically probes and exposes our ambivalent cultural love affair with pristine wilderness. Not only does it provide a nuanced and comprehensive survey of the art of Yosemite, but it also encourages us to critically examine our contradictory desire for Yosemite to be both untouched natural preserve and sought-after tourist destination." Marguerite S. Shaffer, Director of American Studies, Associate Professor of American Studies and History, Miami University, Oxford Ohio<br><br> As Amy Scott puts it in her introduction: In Yosemite, visitors encounter nature but see a work of art.&#x201d; For us to see nature it must be turned into a landscape, a work of art, but always then what we see is the work of art. It is this paradox that the book so skillfully elucidates, in a major contribution that places the visual creation of Yosemite at the heart of western studies, American art, and the role of wilderness in modern urban society. Scott and her colleagues do a magnificent job of capturing Yosemite&#x2019;s significance and its hard realities and complexities, synthesizing current research on the development of Yosemite, and extending that research in many fruitful directions. And the book is beautifully written and illustrated.&#x201d; Bruce Robertson, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Consulting Curator, Los Angeles County Museum of Art<b>Amy Scott </b>is Curator of Visual Arts at the Autry National Center's Museum of the American West, Los Angeles, California. <b>William Deverell </b>is Director of the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West. <b>Kate Nearpass Ogden </b>is Associate Professor of Art History at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. <b>Gary Kurutz </b>is Curator of Special Collections at the California State Library. <b>Brian Bibby </b>is an independent scholar and author. <b>Jennifer Watts </b>is curator of photography at the Huntington Library. <b>Jonathan Spaulding </b>is executive director and chief curator at the Autry National Center's Museum of the American West.</p><h2>Financial Management for Public, Health, and Not-For-Profit Organizations</h2><p><p>One of the few texts that addresses financial and managerial accounting within the three major areas of the public sector.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Financial Management for Public, Health, and Not-for-Profit</i> provides the fundamentals of financial management for those pursuing careers within the public, health and not-for-profit fields.

Analyzing the simultaneous gentrification and Latinization of what is known as El Barrio or Spanish Harlem, <i>Barrio Dreams </i>makes a compelling case that&#x2015;despite neoliberalism's race-and ethnicity-free tenets&#x2015;dreams of economic empowerment are never devoid of distinct racial and ethnic considerations. <br><br>D�vila scrutinizes dramatic shifts in housing, the growth of charter schools, and the enactment of Empowerment Zone legislation that promises upward mobility and empowerment while shutting out many longtime residents. Foregrounding privatization and consumption, she offers an innovative look at the marketing of Latino space. She emphasizes class among Latinos while touching on black-Latino and Mexican-Puerto Rican relations. Providing a unique multifaceted view of the place of Latinos in the changing urban landscape, <i>Barrio Dreams </i>is one of the most nuanced and original examinations of the complex social and economic forces shaping our cities today.</p><p>"D�vila's keen insights into the politics of marketing ethnicity, community marginalization and class divisions cuts through neo-liberal postures to glaringly reveal the real issue - who will construct (and control) East Harlem's future? Well versed in the scholarship, D�vila has produced a book that is essential for understanding the increasingly important role and aspirations of Puerto Rican and Latino communities in New York's history."&#x2015;Virginia S�nchez Korrol, author of <i>From Colonia to Community: The History of Puerto Ricans in New York City</i><br><br>"Providing an expansive ethnographic portal into New York's famous 'El Barrio,' Davila documents the ways in which the neighborhood's Latino cultures can be commodified as a magnet for gentrification as well as providing an obstacle to it. An absorbing read providing a unique contemporary perspective on East Harlem."&#x2015;Neil Smith, author of <i>American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization</i><br><br>"Unlike most ethnographers of the urban poor in search of authentic street experience, D�vila gives us an ethnography of power. With rich insights and sensitivity, she documents the pitched battles between developers, politicians, long-time residents, newcomers, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and African Americans over space, gentrification and cultural representation in East Harlem. D�vila peels back the many layers of local stories in order to reveal a complex, national story of resistance against urban neoliberalism."&#x2015;Robin D. G.

Health troubles and a trolley accident in her youth forced her to spend long periods at home convalescing and she took up painting to pass the time, ultimately developing her own distinctive style which depicted themes drawn from her own life but also contained a strong political message. She married renowned artist Diego Rivera and moved out of <i>la Casa Azul</i>, living in other homes in Mexico and abroad, until eventually returning to her childhood home and converting it into a space that reflected her dedication to Mexican culture.<br><br>Fully illustrated, the book features Frida's paintings together with archive images and family photographs, objects and artefacts she collected and photographs of the surrounding landscape to provide an insight into how these places shaped this much-loved artist and how the homes and landscapes of her life relate to her work.</p><p>Suzanne Barbezat is a writer specializing in Mexico travel, culture and food. She has also worked as a teacher and tour guide, and she holds a bachelor&#39;s degree in Anthropology from McGill University, Montreal."This autumn, a new book published by Frances Lincoln celebrates the profound pleasure Kahlo took in arranging and organising her various homes throughout the course of her 47 years;&nbsp;<i>Frida Kahlo at Home&nbsp;</i>is a voluptuous celebration of the life and work of the artist, viewed through the prism of her various residences. In its pages, decorative artworks become a highly curated archive, and the development and use of different rooms a biographical progression." - Maisie Skidmore, <b>AnOther Magazine</b><br><br>"This is a new spin on Frida Kahlo - a look at the influence of Mexican culture and landscape, her beautiful homes and places she travelled to. It's a visual feast with Frida's paintings plus archival photographs of her life, and Mexico at the time. "Frida made the Blue House her sanctuary, transforming her childhood home into a work of art," writes Barbezat. In this book we get a sense of the struggles but also the joys of Frida's life, plus a glorious insight into her work." - <b>The Australian Women's Weekly</b><br><br>"The many people who are already fascinated with Kahlo will glean further understanding of her art and experience from this fresh study, while general readers will gain a deeper appreciation of the artist." - Marcia G. Welsh, Dartmouth Coll. Lib., Hanover, NH,&nbsp;<b>Library Journal</b></p><h2>Globalizing Capital</h2><p><p>The importance of the international monetary system is clearly evident in daily news stories about fluctuating currencies and in dramatic events such as the recent reversals in the Mexican economy. It has become increasingly apparent that one cannot understand the international economy without knowing how its monetary system operates. Now Barry Eichengreen presents a brief, lucid book that tells the story of the international financial system over the past 150 years. <i>Globalizing Capital</i> is intended not only for economists but also for a general audience of historians, political scientists, professionals in government and business, and anyone with a broad interest in international economic and political relations. Eichengreen's work demonstrates that insights into the international monetary system and effective principles for governing it can result only if it is seen a historical phenomenon extending from the gold standard period to interwar instability, then to Bretton Woods, and finally to the post-1973 period of fluctuating currencies.</p><br><p>Eichengreen analyzes the shift from pegged to floating exchange rates in the 1970s and ascribes that change to the growing capital mobility that has made pegged rates difficult to maintain. However, he shows that capital mobility was also high prior to World War I, yet this did not prevent the maintenance of fixed exchange rates. What was critical for the successful maintenance of fixed exchange rates during that period was the fact that governments were relatively insulated from democratic politics and thus from pressure to trade off exchange rate stability for other goals, such as the reduction of unemployment. Today pegging exchange rates would require very radical reforms of a sort that governments are understandably reluctant to embrace. The implication seems undeniable: floating rates are here to stay.</p></p><p><br> <p>"Eichengreen's purpose is to provide a brief history of the international monetary system. In this, he succeeds magnificently. <i>Globalizing Capital</i> will become a classic."<b>--Douglas Irwin, author of <i>Against the Tide: An Intellectual History of Free Trade</i><br> </b><br> </p><br><b>Barry Eichengreen</b> is the John L.

Rotman draws interesting parallels using the textual code systems of mathematics, painting, and economic exchange and their respective meta-signs -- zero, the vanishing point, imaginary money -- which represent the absence of certain signs. Focusing on the Renaissance period, the author argues that the introduction of a meta-sign disrupts a code system that prompts the creating of new sign systems, as represented by the multifarious transitions from Roman to Hindu numerals, from iconic to perspective art, and from gold money to imaginary bank money. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach...Rotman builds a viable thesis for the semiotics of zero via a thorough examination of Montaigne&#39;s &#39;Essays,&#39; Shakespeare&#39;s &#39;King Lear&#39;, the &#39;Kabbalah,&#39; and Vermeer&#39;s paintings. - Choice</p><p>A delightful analysis. . . .

Family relations, marriages, and dowries were the areas in which women interacted dynamically with men. The three parts of the book discuss the involvement of the state in those interactions; the social and economic consequences for women; and their unexpectedly varied consequences for men of the patriciate. </p><p>The society Chojnacki describes is at once socially complex and highly regulated. On the one hand, women of the Venetian nobility, like patrician women in other cities, were subordinate to their fathers and husbands. But unlike their counterparts elsewhere, Venetian patrician women exercised much control over their own wealth and property and were key players in family strategies. Thanks to advantageous state regulations regarding dowries and marriage practices, Venetian women influenced their fathers' financial and social choices, which in turn affected their fathers' and husbands' attitudes and behavior toward them. Because limited family resources favored some daughters' marriage prospects at the expense of their sisters', the family and marriage practices of the Venetian nobles led to a range of vocations for women, as well as for men.</p></p><p><p><b>Stanley Chojnacki </b> is a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </p><p>"Stanley Chojnacki's distinctive views of the Venetian family have illuminated the gender and family history of Renaissance Italy since the inception of this field in the early 1970s...

Seeking to overturn the inertia and oppression that they believed characterized mainstream architecture, the Utopie group (as they called themselves) designed a series of pneumatic buildings, furniture, and environments, all heavily influenced by American military structures and comic books as well as by the work of Buckminster Fuller, Henri Lefebvre, Jean Baudrillard, and London&#39;s Archigram. Though Utopie architects Jean Aubert, Jean-Paul Jungmann, and Antoine Stinco were unable to realize their dream of a society literally built on air, their fanciful, exuberant, witty, and highly detailed drawings remain some of the most extraordinary in modern architecture. The Inflatable Moment documents this fascinating intersection of architectural, social, and political history, as it presents a complete, annotated catalog of the designs of the Utopie architects alongside similar structures from the period. Essays on the pneumatic phenomenon and the intellectual history of the Utopie group are supplemented by reflections by the three architects, each written especially for this book.</p><p>Marc Dessauce Marc Dessauce, a New York-based architectural historian, is the author of Machinations and a former contributor to Casabella."Lushly illustrated." -- <i>Liane Lefaivre, Architecture</i></p><h2>Selected Poems</h2><p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award</p><p>Read <i>A New Selected Poems</i> to catch Galway Kinnell's myriad fine-tunings of poems decades old; read it for the pleasure of watching his early formalism blossom into long, joyous, almost Whitmanesque lines; but most of all, read it for the eagle's-eye view it provides of one of our finest American poets. Well into his 70s, Kinnell is still producing poetry as visceral as it is philosophical, forging the universal from the fleshy, messy specifics of life. "<i>Lieutenant! / This corpse will not stop burning!</i>" comes the cry in "The Dead Shall Be Raised Incorruptible," a remarkable war poem that literally <i>embodies</i> his political anger. Throughout <i>A New Selected Poems</i>, which Kinnell has culled from eight previous collections spanning 24 years, that corpse burns fiercely, fiercely, as if to heed the poet's own warning from "Another Night in the Ruins": <blockquote> How many nights must it take<br> one such as me to learn<br> that we aren't, after all, made<br> from that bird that flies out of its ashes,<br> that for us<br> as we go up in flames, our one work<br> is<br> to open ourselves, to <i>be</i><br> the flames?<br> </blockquote> Kinnell is a poet who feels life most keenly as it slips through his fingers. Nothing lasts, but this is less cause for lament than for celebration; after all, he tells us, "<i>the wages / of dying is love.</i>" Before we break out the booze and have ourselves a ball, however, there are the poems from his brutal <i>Book of Nightmares</i> to consider, with their apocalyptic howling; his Vermont poems, with their "silent, startled, icy, black language / of blackberry eating in late September"; the noise and clatter of his early New York poems, "Where instants of transcendence / Drift in oceans of loathing and fear..." Kinnell is a poet with a leg in each world, one up above where the bears and porcupines live, and one down below, in what we might call the imaginative underworld. Witness the stunning progression of "When One Has Lived a Long Time Alone," in which he is both Orpheus and a misanthropic Eurydice, singing himself back to the company of the human. How glad we are that Kinnell failed to look back! In the tender "Little Sleep's-Head Sprouting Hair in the Moonlight," the poet advises his infant daughter, "Kiss / the mouth / that tells you, <i>here, / here is the world.</i>" After reading these poems, you might feel like doing the same. <i>--Mary Park</i>Galway Kinnell is a former MacArthur Fellow and has been state poet of Vermont. In 1982 his Selected Poems won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. For many years he was the Erich Maria Remarque Professor of Creative Writing at New York University. He is currently a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. For thirty-five years--from WHAT A KINGDOM IT WAS to THE BOOK OF NIGHTMARES to THREEE BOOKS--Galway Kinnell has been enriching American poetry, not only by his poems but also by his teaching and his powerful public readings.</p><h2>Skymates: The Astrology of Love, Sex and Intimacy</h2><p>Skymates has the same powerful prose, penetrating insights, constructive astrology, and sense of humor as found in The Inner Sky and The Changing Sky.

To the fascination and amusement of more decorous citizens, hundreds of thousands of mostly young dreamers set out to build a new culture apart from the established society. Widely believed by the larger public to be sinks of drug-ridden sexual immorality, the communes both intrigued and repelled the American people. The intentional communities of the 1960s era were far more diverse than the stereotype of the hippie commune would suggest. A great many of them were religious in basis, stressing spiritual seeking and disciplined lifestyles. Others were founded on secular visions of a better society. Hundreds of them became so stable that they survive today. This book surveys the broad sweep of this great social yearning from the first portents of a new type of communitarianism in the early 1960s through the waning of the movement in the mid-1970s. Based on more than five hundred interviews conducted for the 60s Communes Project, among other sources, it preserves a colorful and vigorous episode in American history. The book includes an extensive directory of active and non-active communes, complete with dates of origin and dissolution.</p><p>Choice Outstanding Academic TitleTimothy Miller is a professor of religious studies at the University of Kansas.

The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

It can be used as a textbook for a second, third, or fourth course in computer science, after students have acquired basic programming skills and familiarity with computer systems, but before they have taken specialized courses in advanced areas of computer science or computer applications. The book also may be useful for self-study or as a reference for people engaged in the development of computer systems or applications programs, since it contains implementations of useful algorithms and detailed information on these algorithms' performance characteristics. The broad perspective taken makes the book an appropriate introduction to the field. </p> <p> I have completely rewritten the text for this new edition, and I have added more than a thousand new exercises, more than a hundred new figures, and dozens of new programs. I have also added detailed commentary on all the figures and programs. This new material provides both coverage of new topics and fuller explanations of many of the classic algorithms. A new emphasis on abstract data types throughout the book makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant in modern object-oriented programming environments. People who have read old editions of the book will find a wealth of new information throughout; all readers will find a wealth of pedagogical material that provides effective access to essential concepts. </p> <p> Due to the large amount of new material, we have split the new edition into two volumes (each about the size of the old edition) of which this is the first. This volume covers fundamental concepts, data structures, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms; the second volume covers advanced algorithms and applications, building on the basic abstractions and methods developed here. Nearly all the material on fundamentals and data structures in this edition is new. </p> <p> This book is not just for programmers and computer-science students. Nearly everyone who uses a computer wants it to run faster or to solve larger problems. The algorithms in this book represent a body of knowledge developed over the last 50 years that has become indispensible in the efficient use of the computer, for a broad variety of applications. From N-body simulation problems in physics to genetic-sequencing problems in molecular biology, the basic methods described here have become essential in scientific research; and from database systems to Internet search engines, they have become essential parts of modern software systems. As the scope of computer applications becomes more widespread, so grows the impact of many of the basic methods covered here. The goal of this book is to serve as a resource for students and professionals interested in knowing and making intelligent use of these fundamental algorithms as basic tools for whatever computer application they might undertake. </p> <p><b>Scope</b></p> <p> The book contains 16 chapters grouped into four major parts: fundamentals, data structures, sorting, and searching. The descriptions here are intended to give readers an understanding of the basic properties of as broad a range of fundamental algorithms as possible. Ingenious methods ranging from binomial queues to patricia tries are described, all related to basic paradigms at the heart of computer science. The second volume consists of four additional parts that cover strings, geometry, graphs, and advanced topics. My primary goal in developing these books has been to bring together the fundamental methods from these diverse areas, to provide access to the best methods known for solving problems by computer. </p> <p> You will most appreciate the material in this book if you have had one or two previous courses in computer science or have had equivalent programming experience: one course in programming in a high-level language such as C, Java, or C++, and perhaps another course that teaches fundamental concepts of programming systems. This book is thus intended for anyone conversant with a modern programming language and with the basic features of modern computer systems. References that might help to fill in gaps in your background are suggested in the text. </p> <p> Most of the mathematical material supporting the analytic results is self-contained (or is labeled as beyond the scope of this book), so little specific preparation in mathematics is required for the bulk of the book, although mathematical maturity is definitely helpful. </p> <p><b>Use in the Curriculum</b></p> <p> There is a great deal of flexibility in how the material here can be taught, depending on the taste of the instructor and the preparation of the students. The algorithms described here have found widespread use for years, and represent an essential body of knowledge for both the practicing programmer and the computer-science student. There is sufficient coverage of basic material for the book to be used for a course on data structures, and there is sufficient detail and coverage of advanced material for the book to be used for a course on algorithms. Some instructors may wish to emphasize implementations and practical concerns; others may wish to emphasize analysis and theoretical concepts. </p> <p> A complete set of slide masters for use in lectures, sample programming assignments, interactive exercises for students, and other course materials may be found via the book's home page. </p> <p> An elementary course on data structures and algorithms might emphasize the basic data structures in Part 2 and their use in the implementations in Parts 3 and 4. A course on design and analysis of algorithms might emphasize the fundamental material in Part 1 and Chapter 5, then study the ways in which the algorithms in Parts 3 and 4 achieve good asymptotic performance. A course on software engineering might omit the mathematical and advanced algorithmic material, and emphasize how to integrate the implementations given here into large programs or systems. A course on algorithms might take a survey approach and introduce concepts from all these areas. </p> <p> Earlier editions of this book have been used in recent years at scores of colleges and universities around the world as a text for the second or third course in computer science and as supplemental reading for other courses. At Princeton, our experience has been that the breadth of coverage of material in this book provides our majors with an introduction to computer science that can be expanded upon in later courses on analysis of algorithms, systems programming and theoretical computer science, while providing the growing group of students from other disciplines with a large set of techniques that these people can immediately put to good use. </p> <p> The exercises-most of which are new to this edition-fall into several types. Some are intended to test understanding of material in the text, and simply ask readers to work through an example or to apply concepts described in the text. Others involve implementing and putting together the algorithms, or running empirical studies to compare variants of the algorithms and to learn their properties. Still others are a repository for important information at a level of detail that is not appropriate for the text. Reading and thinking about the exercises will pay dividends for every reader. </p> <p><b>Algorithms of Practical Use</b></p> <p> Anyone wanting to use a computer more effectively can use this book for reference or for self-study. People with programming experience can find information on specific topics throughout the book. To a large extent, you can read the individual chapters in the book independently of the others, although, in some cases, algorithms in one chapter make use of methods from a previous chapter. </p> <p> The orientation of the book is to study algorithms likely to be of practical use. The book provides information about the tools of the trade to the point that readers can confidently implement, debug, and put to work algorithms to solve a problem or to provide functionality in an application. Full implementations of the methods discussed are included, as are descriptions of the operations of these programs on a consistent set of examples. Because we work with real code, rather than write pseudo-code, the programs can be put to practical use quickly. Program listings are available from the book's home page. </p> <p> Indeed, one practical application of the algorithms has been to produce the hundreds of figures throughout the book. Many algorithms are brought to light on an intuitive level through the visual dimension provided by these figures. </p> <p> Characteristics of the algorithms and of the situations in which they might be useful are discussed in detail. Although not emphasized, connections to the analysis of algorithms and theoretical computer science are developed in context. When appropriate, empirical viand analytic results are presented to illustrate why certain algorithms are preferred. When interesting, the relationship of the practical algorithms being discussed to purely theoretical results is described. Specific information on performance characteristics of algorithms and implementations is synthesized, encapsulated, and discussed throughout the book. </p> <p><b>Programming Language</b></p> <p> The programming language used for all of the implementations is C. Any particular language has advantages and disadvantages; we use C because it is widely available and provides the features needed for our implementations. The programs can be translated easily to other modern programming languages, since relatively few constructs are unique to C. We use standard C idioms when appropriate, but this book is not intended to be a reference work on C programming. </p> <p> There are many new programs in this edition, and many of the old ones have been reworked, primarily to make them more readily useful as abstract-data-type implementations. Extensive comparative empirical tests on the programs are discussed throughout the text.</p> <p>Previous editions of the book have presented basic programs in Pascal, C++, and Modula-3. This code is available through the book home page on the web; code for new programs and code in new languages such as Java will be added as appropriate. </p> <p> A goal of this book is to present the algorithms in as simple and direct a form as possible. The style is consistent whenever possible, so that programs that are similar look similar. For many of the algorithms in this book, the similarities hold regardless of the language: Quicksort is quicksort (to pick one prominent example), whether expressed in Algol-60, Basic, Fortran, Smalltalk, Ada, Pascal, C, PostScript, Java, or countless other programming languages and environments where it has proved to be an effective sorting method. </p> <p> We strive for elegant, compact, and portable implementations, but we take the point of view that efficiency matters, so we try to be aware of the performance characteristics of our code at all stages of development. Chapter 1 constitutes a detailed example of this approach to developing efficient C implementations of our algorithms, and sets the stage for the rest of the book. </p> <p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p> <p> Many people gave me helpful feedback on earlier versions of this book. In particular, hundreds of students at Princeton and Brown have suffered through preliminary drafts over the years. Special thanks are due to Trina Avery and Tom Freeman for their help in producing the first edition; to Janet Incerpi for her creativity and ingenuity in persuading our early and primitive digital computerized typesetting hardware and software to produce the first edition; to Marc Brown for his part in the algorithm visualization research that was the genesis of so many of the figures in the book; and to Dave Hanson for his willingness to answer all of my questions about C. I would also like to thank the many readers who have provided me with detailed comments about various editions, including Guy Almes, Jon Bentley, Marc Brown, Jay Gischer, Allan Heydon, Kennedy Lemke, Udi Manber, Dana Richards, John Reif, M. Rosenfeld, Stephen Seidman, Michael Quinn, and William Ward. </p> <p> To produce this new edition, I have had the pleasure of working with Peter Gordon and Debbie Lafferty at Addison-Wesley, who have patiently shepherded this project as it has evolved from a standard update to a massive rewrite. It has also been my pleasure to work with several other members of the professional staff at Addison-Wesley. The nature of this project made the book a somewhat unusual challenge for many of them, and I much appreciate their forbearance. </p> <p> I have gained two new mentors in writing this book, and particularly want to express my appreciation to them. First, Steve Summit carefully checked early versions of the manuscript on a technical level, and provided me with literally thousands of detailed comments, particularly on the programs. Steve clearly understood my goal of providing elegant, efficient, and effective implementations, and his comments not only helped me to provide a measure of consistency across the implementations, but also helped me to improve many of them substantially. Second, Lyn DuprE also provided me with thouands of detailed comments on the manuscript, which were invaluable in helping me not only to correct and avoid grammatical errors, but also-more important-to find a consistent and coherent writing style that helps bind together the daunting mass of technical material here. viiiI am extremely grateful for the opportunity to learn from Steve and Lyn-their input was vital in the development of this book. </p> <p> Much of what I have written here I have learned from the teaching and writings of Don Knuth, my advisor at Stanford. Although Don had no direct in uence on this work, his presence may be felt in the book, for it was he who put the study of algorithms on the scientific footing that makes a work such as this possible. My friend and colleague Philippe Flajolet, who has been a major force in the development of the analysis of algorithms as a mature research area, has had a similar in uence on this work. </p> <p> I am deeply thankful for the support of Princeton University, Brown University, and the Institut National de Recherce en Informatique et Automatique (INRIA), where I did most of the work on the book; and of the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where I did some work on the book while visiting. Many parts of the book are dependent on research that has been generously supported by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research. Finally, I thank Bill Bowen, Aaron Lemonick, and Neil Rudenstine for their support in building an academic environment at Princeton in which I was able to prepare this book, despite my numerous other responsibilities. </p> <strong> <p> Robert Sedgewick<br> Marly-le-Roi, France, February, 1983<br> Princeton, New Jersey, January, 1990<br> Jamestown, Rhode Island, August, 1997 </p> </strong> <br> <br> 0201314525P04062001</p><h2>Friendly Chemistry Annotated Solutions Manual</h2><p>The Friendly Chemistry Annotated Solutions Manual provides annotated solutions to all worksheet and test problems within the Friendly Chemistry course.

Its poets mark the conflict in ways that are both intensely personal and as enduring as any monument. Their lines have come to express the feelings of a nation about the horrors and consequences of war.<br> <br>This new anthology provides a definitive record of the achievements of the Great War poets and offers a fresh assessment of the work on the centenary of the Great War's outbreak. Focusing on the poets themselves, the book is organized by writer, not theme or chronology. It offers generous selections from the celebrated soldier-poets, including Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, and Rupert Brooke, whilst also incorporating less well-known writing by civilian and women poets. It also includes two previously unpublished poems by Ivor Gurney. <br> <br>A general introduction charts the history of the war poets' reception and challenges prevailing myths about the war poets' progress from idealism to bitterness. The work of each poet is prefaced with a biographical account that sets the poems in their historical context. <br><br>Although the War has now passed out of living memory, its haunting of our language and culture has not been exorcised. Its poetry survives because it continues to speak to and about us.<br></p><p><br><strong>Tim Kendall</strong> has taught at the universities of Oxford, Newcastle, and Bristol before becoming Professor and Head of English at the University of Exeter.

He is also co-editor of the forthcoming <em>Complete Literary Works of Ivor Gurney</em>.<br>*Starred Review* More than any other conflict, the Great War, &#x201c;the war to end all wars,&#x201d; changed the world, sufficiently so that historian John Lukacs has remarked that the twentieth century really begins with it. It certainly made poetry modern&#x2014;&#x201c;common&#x201d; in diction, grammar, and subject matter while fully cognizant of the poetic past&#x2014;as did no other phenomenon of its time. For once they had seen what this monstrously brutal new form of warfare was, soldier-poets determined to make readers appreciate its filth, pain, and horror. None were more conscientious about this than the British and Irish solder-poets, and it is their work that appears in Kendall&#x2019;s new anthology. Kendall also includes poems by civilians who wrote most powerfully about war (Hardy, Kipling, and the now-obscure, then-famous Wilfrid Gibson) and several women who served in field hospitals and as ambulance drivers. The collection concludes with a sterling small treasury of &#x201c;Music-Hall and Trench Songs&#x201d; (Kendall admits to cleaning the latter up for general consumption). Kendall sketches the life of each poet included, glosses military jargon and slang terms as well as place names and literary allusions in the endnotes, and includes two previously unpublished poems by a personal favorite, the composer-poet Ivor Gurney. A timely memorial and a great anthology. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Portable TA: A Physics Problem Solving Guide, Volume I</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Herbs can be used as seeds, flowers, or leaves; cooked and eaten themselves or used to infuse a dish or drink. They are popping up in artisan gin, ice cubes and cocktail syrups; in foraged dishes and kitchen gardens of the best restaurants as chefs realise that often the only way to capture that elusive flavour is to have home-grown, freshly harvested herbs on their doorstep. With this book these intense flavours can now be a reality for gardeners and food enthusiasts with any size of garden, from an acre to a window box. Underpinned by the authority of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the expertise of Holly Farrell this book combines practical elements with inspiration and beauty.&nbsp; Find out how to grow herbs in all situations, how to plant, propagate and harvest, then the 80 most exciting herbs are identified, illustrated and their uses explained.

In this revelatory work, Stanford historian Caroline Winterer argues that a national mythology of a unitary, patriotic era of enlightenment in America was created during the Cold War to act as a shield against the threat of totalitarianism, and that Americans followed many paths toward political, religious, scientific, and artistic enlightenment in the 1700s that were influenced by European models in more complex ways than commonly thought. Winterer&#x2019;s book strips away our modern inventions of the American national past, exploring which of our ideas and ideals are truly rooted in the eighteenth century and which are inventions and mystifications of more recent times.</p><p><b>Caroline Winterer </b> is Anthony P.

Her book is a major accomplishment."&#x2014;Daniel Walker Howe, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815&#x2013;1848</i><br>"In a lively prose style that is as convincing as it is entertaining, Caroline Winterer comprehensively covers the American Enlightenment generously defined as the whole North American continent."&#x2014;Joyce Appleby, professor emerita of history, University of California, Los Angeles, and author of <i>Shores of Knowledge: New World Discoveries and the Scientific Imagination</i><br>"<i>American Enlightenments</i> advances our conception of Enlightenment&#x2014;both in America and Europe&#x2014;in powerful ways. With chapters devoted to everything from seashells and geology to the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica, Winterer convincingly argues that our perception of a unified 'American Enlightenment' is a myth, while at the same time showing Enlightenment in general to be a conversation that required and included America."&#x2014;Mark A. Peterson, University of California, Berkeley<br>"Caroline Winterer&#x2019;s luminous study of the correspondence chains that bound figures like Franklin and Jefferson to their counterparts in Europe shows us an Enlightenment far richer than any we have seen before.

Rodgers, Princeton University<br></p><h2>The Genius of Shakespeare</h2><p>This fascinating book by one of Britain's most acclaimed young Shakespeare scholars explores the extraordinary staying-power of Shakespeare's work. Bate opens by taking up questions of authorship, asking, for example, Who was Shakespeare, based on the little documentary evidence we have? Which works really are attributable to him? And how extensive was the influence of Christopher Marlowe? Bate goes on to trace Shakespeare's canonization and near- deification, examining not only the uniqueness of his status among English-speaking readers but also his effect on literate cultures across the globe. <br><br> Ambitious, wide-ranging, and historically rich, this book shapes a provocative inquiry into the nature of genius as it ponders the legacy of a talent unequalled in English letters.

Yet when in 1936 the land was divided by the most disastrous civil war of this century, individuals and governments of many nations became involved. This book is an account of how and why things turned out as they did. The answers lie in the labyrinth of Spanish history between 1874 and 1936. Mr Brenan charts this labyrinth, disentangling and identifying the separate forces for disunity; he explains the part played by the Church, the army, and the various political parties - Anarchists, Anarcho-Syndicalists, Carlists and Socialists; and he shows how industrial unrest, unequal privileges, agrarian discontent, and provincial loyalties each had a share in producing a war in which &#39;the vanquished were beaten and the victors defeated&#39;.</p><p>Written during and immediately after the Spanish Civil War, this classic account of its background represents a struggle to see issues in Spanish politics objectively, despite the author&#39;s personal involvement.An account of the social and political background of the Spanish Civil War.</p><h2>Saint Therese of Lisieux: Her Life, Times, and Teaching</h2><p>Baeautiful coffee table book about St. Therese, the Little Flower.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>Espanol Esencial: Book 1</h2><p>This is the first book in the Espa�ol Esencial Series which is a three-volume series that offers a comprehensive review and thorough understanding of the elements of the Spanish language.

Its allegory is crudely transparent, and the ideas have lost their political urgency. (The book was published in 1938, a decade before Orwell's 1984.) But Anthem provides a good introduction to Rand's philosophy of "objectivism," which is built on individuality, freedom, and reason.

In spare, poetic prose, Fletcher describes the twilight of mornings and evenings, those two brief times of day that often seem to have magical qualities. He personifies dawn and dusk and uses images and metaphors to evoke their special qualities and events. The full- and double-paged oil paintings depict a suburban community. A young girl and her dog wander through the scenes, adding interest even though they are never mentioned in the text. Various shades of green, orange, and brown are used effectively to show how the colors of things are transformed by twilight. The personification of dawn and dusk seems strained, and the metaphors are sometimes more distracting than illuminating, e.g., dusk "pours/the syrup of darkness/into the forest" and "hisses on the sprinklers." The pictures speak more clearly than the words.

While managers' conversations are generally transactional and centered on the task at hand, leaders must focus on people, asking great questions and aligning them with the vision for the future. Leadership mindsets and skills can be developed, and Leadership Conversations provides practical guidance for connecting with others in ways that transform each interaction into an opportunity for organizational and personal growth.</p> <ul> <li>Identifies four types of conversation every leader must master: building relationships, making decisions, taking action, and developing others</li> <li>Provides an action plan for boosting your personal leadership potential, as well for developing leadership skills in others</li> <li>Draws on the authors' rich experience coaching and working with leaders at a wide range of organizations, including NASA, the U.S. Navy, intelligence agencies, Boeing, Gillette, Bausch &amp; Lomb, and Georgetown University</li> </ul> <p><i>Leadership Conversations</i> is required reading for both high-potential managers looking to make it to the next level and leaders looking to develop their people.</p></p><p><p><b>Q &amp; A with Alan Berson and Richard Stieglitz, authors of <em>Leadership Conversations</em></b></p> <strong>What are leadership conversations?</strong> <p>Every day, people engage in four types of leadership conversations, those that: build relationships, develop others, make decisions, and take action. As people rise to higher positions, the challenges they encounter require communication skills that few leaders or managers instinctively possess and that are only now being taught in top MBA and executive training programs. <em>Leadership Conversations</em> shows people how to engage in conversations that create connection and alignment, integrate multiple viewpoints, and produce superior results.</p> <strong>How is a management mindset different from a leadership mindset?</strong> <p>Those having conversations with a leadership mindset address possibilities, encourage the exchanges of ideas, and create learning experiences--they focus on the bigger picture, strategy, and long term vision. Those having conversations with a management mindset process information, evaluate alternatives, complete tasks, and meet deadlines--they get things done. As an example, if the completion date for a project was today, a management mindset would be most effective--the conversations focus on finishing the job. On the other hand, discussing strategic possibilities is best done with a leadership mindset that encourages creativity and free-thinking. People speak with bosses, peers, direct reports, and other stakeholders frequently, but too often their conversations use one mindset when the other is appropriate. <em>Leadership Conversations</em> shows how to blend the two mindsets in ways that are appropriate to both a person's position and the situation at hand.</p> <strong>Why are leadership conversations important?</strong> <p>People whose careers get stuck or suffer bumps tell us they wish they could go back and do things over. <em>Leadership Conversations</em> is about succeeding the first time, helping you and the people who work for you to prepare for the future and get things done today. The book presents concepts, case studies, and practical tools to show people how to hold better, more effective conversations that align followers and leaders. It also provides an assessment that measures your leadership and management strengths and guides you to prepare a personal action plan. The book is designed for those looking to advance into top leadership roles, as well as those looking to mentor rising stars.</p> <strong>What would you recommend to a high-potential manager looking to improve leadership skills and conversations?</strong> <p>Engage three perspectives in your leadership conversations. (1) Exchange ideas: Each person presents their ideas, states their positions and intentions clearly, and provides pertinent facts for others to consider. (2) Understand others: Each person asks questions to understand the points that others have made, as well as the context and emotions behind them. (3) Explore possibilities: People consider the what-else-is-possible aspects of a topic in context with the bigger picture. Conversations with the third perspective frequently combine ideas in bold, innovative, and valuable ways. Few people consciously use all three perspectives, yet the ability to employ each of them is a shared trait of great leaders.</p><b>Praise for <i>Leadership Conversations</i></b> <p>"In their brilliant new book, <i>Leadership Conversations</i>, Alan Berson and Richard Stieglitz offer proven methods, instructive examples, and provocative questions that enable leaders to engage in more meaningful conversations&#x2014;the kinds of conversations that produce innovative solutions, cause deep self-examination, and stimulate disciplined development.

When their toddler handed them an acorn from the tree, Meyers, a nurseryman, planted it in their back yard.<br> That acorn was the inspiration for an immensely popular project, America's Famous &amp; Historic Trees, sponsored by American Forests, the country's oldest nonprofit conservation organization. Through this program, Meyers and his volunteers have collected seeds from more than a thousand different historic trees, which are grown to sapling size in the project's nursery. The descendants of these famous trees have been planted on the grounds of state capitols, in schoolyards, and in back yards across the country. In this fascinating book, Meyers tells the stories of seventeen historic trees, describes their role in America's history, and tells how their seeds were collected and their offspring propagated. For readers who want to grow a replica of an important tree themselves, each chapter contains instructions for planting the seeds of that particular species.<br> Among the trees in this book are the Indian Marker Pecan, dating back to the 1600s, when Comanche warriers would mark a good camping spot by tying a young pecan tree to the ground. At the other end of the time line is the Moon Sycamore, grown from seeds that traveled to the moon in 1971 on Apollo 14.<br> Trees associated with presidents are George Washington's Tulip Poplar, Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address Honey Locust, Andrew Jackson's Southern Magnolia (planted at the White House in memory of his wife), and John F. Kennedy's Post Oak, which grows beside his grave at Arlington National Cemetery. Most of the original trees still stand, but in some cases all that remains of their place in history are the seeds propagated by Meyers and his group. These include the last Johnny Appleseed Rambo Apple tree and the last Lewis and Clark Cottonwood.</p><p>Nurseryman Jeffrey Meyer founded the Famous and Historic Trees Project as a way of preserving and propagating the past. The project began after his son came to him with an acorn fallen from Jacksonville, Florida's "Treaty Live Oak"--a vast old tree growing in the spot where the Timucuan tribe sat for tribal councils. Meyer took the acorn home and planted it in his backyard. "From that little acorn also germinated the idea of growing descendants of important trees," he notes. <p> <i>America's Famous and Historic Trees</i> tells the stories of various trees that Meyer and his cohorts rescued or propagated: oftentimes, when trees were going to be cut down, he and his workers headed off the bulldozers, rescuing the tree with their massive tree hoe. Other trees--like the Indian Marker Pecan in southeast Dallas--were propagated before they died. Some of the ancestor trees still stand in their historic places--like Elvis Presley's Pin Oaks on the grounds of Graceland. Chapters here follow the trials and tribulations of specific trees, and end with "how to propagate" instructions for a wide variety of species: sycamore, cottonwood, bur oak, magnolia. This book is not about photographs--what images are included are simply of big trees alongside houses or suburban developments, awkward and misplaced, like an elegant old man in a multiplex. Meyer hopes to inspire his readers to plant and nurture forests that will outlive them, and to rescue trees from the unknown forces of the future by revering their pasts. <i>--Emily White</i></p>"Jeff Meyer makes the act of growing a tree irresistible, with the help of the images and stories of some of this country's most wonderful old specimens. For yourself, your children, your earth, read this book and grow some trees!" &#x2013;Don Henley, recording artist and founder for the Walden Woods Project <p>"When I was growing up, my grandmother told me of a saying she attributed to Johnny Appleseed: 'Great is the person who plants a tree, knowing he will need to sit in its shade.' I hope after reading this book, you will be inspired to plant a tree." &#x2013;Dr. Robert D. Ballard, author and explorer </p><p>"Jeff Meyer is the twenty-first century's own Johnny Appleseed. He has a huge, infectious love of trees, and his passion for the preservation of our historical legacy through trees is a tremendous inspiration." &#x2013;Cherie Lucks, great-great-grandniece of John Chapman, a.k.a. Johnny Appleseed </p><p>"I applaud this book and the efforts of American Forests in sharing the many stories of trees that have been witness to historical periods in America." &#x2013;Dale Chihuly, renowned glass artist</p></p><h2>More or Less (MathStart 2)</h2><p><p>Is your age more than 5?<br>Is it less than 10?</p><p>Eddie's got to guess. And he doesn't want to be wrong!</p><p>Eddie has a booth at the school fair, guessing people's ages. He hasn't guessed wrong yet, but if he does, he gets dunked. Can Eddie keep guessing right -- and keep from getting wet?</p><p>Comparing whole numbers and understanding what's more and what's less are a big part of Eddie's strategy, and an important math skill for young readers to learn.</p></p><p><p>Stuart J. Murphy is a visual learning specialist. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, he has a strong background in design and art direction. He also has extensive experience in the world of educational publishing. Drawing on all these talents, Stuart J. Murphy brings a unique perspective to the MathStart series. In MathStart books, pictures do more than tell stories; they teach math.</p><p> Stuart J. Murphy and his wife, Nancy, live in Boston.</p><br><br>David Wenzel has illustrated <em>Middle Earth:The World of Tolkien Illustrated, The Kingdom of the Dwarfs,</em> and created the <em>Hidden Kingdom</em> line of greeting cards. He lives in Durham, CT.Gr. 1-3. The concept of comparing numbers gets Murphy's signature MathStart treatment--by turns amusing and teaching. In this story, Eddie works the "guess the age" booth at the fair. Blindfolded, he listens to a contestant's voice, and if he guesses a person's age "after three questions or less," he wins. The contestant gets a prize if Eddie has to ask four or more questions. If Eddie hasn't guessed after six tries, he gets dunked in a pool. The way Eddie progresses (he arrives at his answers by narrowing his guess to a number more than or less than another number) leads children into the world of logical, educated guesses. A subplot about a girl trying to win a prize cleverly ties into the main story. Youngsters who need to understand the math concept in more depth will find several activities at the conclusion of the book. These are meant to be done with help from adults, to whom the back matter is directed.

"Get here already."<br><br> The wretched clock refused to cooperate. It read two forty-seven, and the second hand seemed to be taking way too long to sweep around the clock's face. Thirteen minutes until I could pack up and head home.<br><br> Diesel, my Maine Coon cat and near-constant companion, warbled anxiously from the area next to my feet under the reference desk. He always picked up on my emotions, and I forced myself to calm down. There was no point in getting a nearly forty-pound cat all wound up. Nor myself, actually.<br><br> "It's all okay, boy," I told him in a low voice before I reached under the desk to scratch his head. "We'll be home soon." I think the cat knew what-or really, who-was waiting for us at home, and he was as eager as I to be there.<br><br> Clock check. Only eleven minutes to go. I could leave now if I really wanted to. I volunteered at the Athena Public Library. I did not earn a paycheck from the place. I knew, though, how much the director, Teresa Farmer, and the other staff appreciated my help on Fridays, and I wasn't going to cut my time short. I settled back into my chair for the remaining minutes and glanced around me.<br><br> On this late July afternoon, the only people I saw in the library were adults, mostly my own age or older. Some, no doubt, sought relief from the punishing heat. The soaring temperatures taxed air conditioners, and there were many elderly people in Athena who couldn't afford to cool their houses. I knew most of those who came into the library to get relief, at least by name.<br><br> One man was a definite stranger, however. I first noticed him a week ago. Tall, a bit stooped, with a shambling gait, he looked to be about ten years older than me, so that put him in his midsixties, though he might have been older. I'd not had any interaction with him last week, and he had not come near the reference desk today. He had glanced my way a couple of times, his expression a puzzled frown.<br><br> I wondered whether he knew me or thought that he might. I had never seen him before that I could recall, though there was an elusive familiarity about his face. Maybe I had run across him thirty years ago, I mused, before I left Athena to move to Texas for graduate school in library science. I couldn't place him, but I hadn't spent much energy trying. I had learned over the years to let such things resolve themselves on their own schedule. The answer to this particular puzzle, if I knew it, would occur to me in due course.<br><br> Earlier today I had thought about approaching him and simply asking him who he was, but I hesitated to follow through on that. He appeared reserved and perhaps shy, and I didn't want to intrude if he truly had no desire to talk to people. I glanced his way again, and he looked up for a moment. Then he dipped his head down, focused once more on the book in his lap, and I read that as a clear signal that he did not want to be interrupted.<br><br> Diesel chirped and laid a large paw on my knee, as if he were asking me the time, and I checked the clock. Two minutes to three. Bronwyn Forster, one of the full-time librarians, should be here to relieve me any moment now. Sure enough, when I looked toward the area where the offices were, I saw her emerge from the doorway and head toward us.<br><br> After we greeted her, and she and I exchanged places, Diesel stayed with Bronwyn while I went to gather my things. He had to be sure to get his full quota of rubs on the head and under the chin before we left. Bronwyn, like the other staff and many of the patrons, never hesitated to oblige him. No wonder he loved coming to work with me.<br><br> Back at the desk again, I spoke to Bronwyn. "Would you mind keeping him with you for a minute? It's so hot outside, I want to get the car started and cooling off before I put him in it."<br><br> Bronwyn gave me her habitual sweet smile. "Of course, Charlie. Diesel won't mind getting loved on for a couple more minutes."<br><br> I heard a happy warble from behind the desk and knew Diesel would be content until I was ready to take him out. "Back in a minute, then." I headed for the door.<br><br> The second I stepped outside the heat swarmed around me like a cloud of gnats. I could feel the sweat starting to form as I made my way through the parking lot to the far side where the staff usually parked. This morning I had found a spot beneath the largest tree that cast shade over the lot. That meant the inside of my car was a few degrees cooler than it might have been otherwise.<br><br> I backed the car out and drove it around the lot to the closest spot to the front door. I left the engine running and went into the building to retrieve my cat. The moment I called, he came running around the desk toward me.<br><br> I scooped him up in both arms and backed out the door, with one last farewell to Bronwyn. The temperature was too high today-hovering around the century mark-to let Diesel walk over the hot asphalt and concrete. In weather like this I carried Diesel to and from buildings where the sidewalks and parking areas were in the direct sunlight. I didn't want him blistering the pads of his feet.<br><br> The drive home took less than ten minutes, and once I had the car parked in my garage, I let Diesel out of the backseat. He preceded me into the kitchen where I knew we would find the object of our intense interest.<br><br> When I stepped into the room I saw my daughter, Laura, sitting at the table, feeding my grandson, and chatting with Azalea Berry, my housekeeper. Diesel approached Laura slowly. When he reached her side, he looked up at her and chirped twice.<br><br> "Hello, handsome boy," Laura said. "We're almost through here, and then I'll let you see him. How about that?"<br><br> Diesel warbled in happiness. He loved the baby and could sit near him and watch him for long periods of time. Until both he and the baby fell asleep, that is.<br><br> I greeted both women and put my things on the small table by the door. I moved closer to Laura and my grandson and watched for a moment. Then my vision blurred, and I had to slip my handkerchief out of my pocket to wipe my eyes.<br><br> "How is young Master Charles Franklin Salisbury?" I asked, my voice husky.<br><br> Laura laughed as she looked up at me. "Like his grandfather, always ready for a meal."<br><br> Azalea chuckled at that. "That baby sure is a chip off this old block." She slid a sly glance in my direction. "How about something for you, Mr. Granddaddy?"<br><br> I grinned at the silly nickname Azalea gave me not long after baby Charlie was born. We were all giddy with happiness over the arrival of this child. I hated that his grandmother and his great-great aunt weren't alive to see him, but I knew they were watching over him. I sometimes felt their presence here in the kitchen. Like now, when a whisper of air passed my right ear.<br><br> "I wouldn't mind a cold glass of water," I replied. "This horrible heat wave makes me thirsty."<br><br> "I'm glad to hear you ask for water instead of a diet soda." Laura smiled at me. "You were drinking way too much of it. It's good that you've cut back."<br><br> After a satisfying couple of sips from the glass Azalea handed me, I raised an eyebrow at Laura and sniffed. "You wouldn't say that if you hadn't had to give up the exact same beverage while you were breastfeeding my grandson."<br><br> "Ha-ha," Laura replied. "By the time this young man is off the breast, I will have completely forgotten what the ambrosia tasted like." She sighed. "No wine until then, either. That I will definitely go back to, believe me."<br><br> "I didn't think you had to cut caffeine out completely, though," I said as I took a seat across the table from Laura and baby Charlie.<br><br> "No, I don't, but it needs to be limited," Laura said. "I still have a little, mostly coffee or tea, but nothing like what my intake used to be."<br><br> I recalled her teenage years-and probably the years spent in California while she pursued her acting career-when she seemed to live on diet drinks, salads, wine, and cheese, with the occasional hamburger and french fries on the side.<br><br> "How is his rash?" I nodded toward the baby.<br><br> "Almost completely cleared up," Laura said. "His doctor said that infant acne is fairly common and usually clears up on its own."<br><br> "I don't remember whether you or Sean had that," I said. "I don't think you did, though."<br><br> "It's all due to maternal hormones," Laura replied. "His little face will be completely smooth again in another day or two."<br><br> Diesel chirped as if to acknowledge gratification at this news.<br><br> Azalea placed a stack of mail in front of me. "You hit the jackpot today."<br><br> "Half of it at least will go in the recycling bin." I eyed the pile with a jaundiced glance. There were three catalogs, several circulars, and four letters. I pushed the catalogs and circulars aside and picked up the envelopes.<br><br> "When I was a little girl," Laura said, "you used to give me all the mail you didn't want so that I could pretend it was my mail."<br><br> "Yes, I did." I laughed. "You would sit and read through it so solemnly."<br><br> Laura rolled her eyes. "I must have been adorable, thinking I was important enough to have mail like my father."<br><br> "You were, and still are, adorable," I told her.<br><br> "Mushy," Laura said, but she smiled.<br><br> The first two letters were junk mail. The third was a legitimate bill. The fourth, however, seemed to be of a personal nature. The return address and my name and address were all handwritten.<br><br> I glanced at the return address. The name was Jack Pemberton, and the town was Tullahoma, a smaller town about eighty miles southwest of Athens. I didn't recognize the sender of the letter. I couldn't recall ever having met someone of that name.<br><br> Curious, I opened the letter by tearing a small strip off one end. I extracted the pages inside, along with what looked like a bookmark. Pemberton might be a writer, I decided. Was he trying a direct-mail approach to selling books?<br><br> I examined the bookmark first. One side showed two images of book covers, both with slightly lurid illustrations. I laid the bookmark aside and opened the letter. I scanned it quickly, impatient as usual to figure out what the import was. Then I went back and read it more carefully.<br><br> I frowned and laid the pages aside.<br><br> "What is it, Dad?" Laura said. "Bad news?"<br><br> "Not news at all." I laughed, suddenly struck by the seeming absurdity of the letter writer's intent. "A man from Tullahoma wants to write a book about me."<br><br> "About you? Why?" Azalea asked, obviously puzzled. Then suddenly her face cleared and she scowled. "About all your murders, you mean."<br><br> Two<br><br> "They're not my murders, Azalea." I shook my head. "I may have helped solve them in some way, but I didn't go looking for trouble to get into. I can assure you of that."<br><br> "You might not have gone looking for it, but you didn't run away from trouble when you found it, Dad." Laura cocked an eyebrow at me. "I know it's not by choice, but you have to admit you got a lot of satisfaction out of figuring them out when the killer wasn't immediately obvious."<br><br> "I will admit that," I said. "I've been reading mysteries for nearly fifty years, so it's pretty hard to resist one when it practically falls into your lap."<br><br> "Or you stumble over the body." Laura grimaced. "Not something I want to experience ever again myself. Once was enough for me."<br><br> "I know, sweetheart." I remembered how upset she had been when she found her former boyfriend dead, the victim of murder.<br><br> "Kanesha might not be too happy to see you getting all the credit in a book, either." Laura wiped the baby's mouth, refastened her blouse, and then laid Charlie on her shoulder to burp him.<br><br> Laura referred to Kanesha Berry, chief deputy in the Athena County Sheriff's Department, and the official investigator of murders in the county. She also happened to be my housekeeper's daughter, a situation that Kanesha had never regarded with good grace.<br><br> Azalea snorted at Laura's observation. "That girl better thank the good Lord Mr. Charlie's been willing to help her out. Some of those murders were downright strange." She favored me with an oblique glance when she hit that last word.<br><br> "Strange murders or not, Kanesha got the credit in all those cases," I said. "I may have helped her solve them more quickly in some instances, but I have no doubt whatsoever that she would have figured them out all on her own. I also have no doubt that she would have preferred it that way."<br><br> "Then what are you going to tell the man who wants to interview you?" Laura asked.<br><br> "I haven't decided yet," I responded. "I want to talk it over with Helen Louise first."<br><br> Helen Louise Brady, owner of the best French bistro south of Memphis, was my best friend and also my girlfriend. Some might consider the word girlfriend old-fashioned, but I was an old-fashioned kind of guy in many respects, including romantic relationships.<br><br> "Now that she's cut back her hours at the bistro," Laura said, "you at least have more time to talk, instead of only late at night after the bistro's closed or when you go in there for a meal."<br><br> "You'd think so." I tried not to sound irritable. "But Helen Louise is having a harder time letting go of some of the responsibility than she expected."<br><br> "I thought she had worked everything out," Azalea said. "Isn't that young man been working there doing good as a baker?"<br><br> "Henry?" I said. "Yes, he's doing fine, but I think he's getting a bit exasperated with Helen Louise. She tends to hover and hang around later than she says she will."<br><br> "She's put so much of her life into that place," Laura said as baby Charlie emitted a burp. She and I exchanged smiles.</p><h2>Listen to the Trees</h2><p>It is rare that the soul and presentation of a book truly mirror and celebrate its subject matter. Listen to the Trees, John Sexton's homage to these stately and eloquent voices of nature, accomplishes this mission. Photographs of trees are the heart of Sexton's work, and the luminous images in this collection embody the distinctive vision he has developed by listening closely to the natural world. From the quiet dignity of eucalyptus bark enfolding in its cycle of renewal to the sweeping grace of a mature aspen forest, these photographs brilliantly evoke the essence of trees - their primeval strength, their beauty, and their serenity.<br>Stewart L. Udall's introduction and James Baker's essay provide intriguing insights into our contemporary, historical, and mythological relationship with trees. The portfolio of images is coupled with inspiring excerpts from prose and poetry by an eclectic group of writers, among them Father Thomas Berry, Black Elk, Robinson Jeffers, Starhawk, and Minor White.</p><p></p><h2>The Jungle Book (Union Square Kids Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>Award-winning illustrator Robert Ingpen offers his stunning version of another classic: Rudyard Kipling's beloved stories of the boy Mowgli, rescued and raised by tigers in the heart of the jungle.

John Forrester probes the origins of psychoanalysis and its most beguiling concept, the transference, which is at once its institutional axis and experimental core. He explores the most seductive of all recent psychoanalytic traditions, that inspired by Jacques Lacan, whose radical questioning of psychoanalytic effects has been continued implicitly by Michel Foucault and explicitly by Jacques Derrida. Other key questions addressed include the significance of speech in the talking cure, and the relationship between the &#39;real&#39; of psychoanalysis and the fictionality of the &#39;truth&#39; it offers. Dr Forrester also focuses on the relationship between psychoanalysis and the feminine, on analysis and gossip, on the borderline of seduction and rape, and on the women who have played such a crucial role in the history of psychoanalysis, as patients, analysts or both.</p><p>An exploration of the historical development of psychoanalysis and its most intriguing concept, the transference, in accordance with the respective traditions inspired by Freud, Lacan and Derrida.&#34;Forrester interprets and develops Freud in extremely interesting ways, describing the discursive richness, intensity, and difficulties inherent in the &#39;analytic position&#39; and vividly portraying the nature and structure of psychoanalytic discourse....The section on Lacan is especially clear....This excellent collection of essays is recommended....&#34; Choice</p><h2>Follow the Story: How to Write Successful Nonfiction</h2><p>An indispensable guide to nonfiction writing from the Columbia Journalism School professor and Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist behind the bestsellers <i>Blind Eye</i>, <i>Blood Sport</i>, and <i>Den of Thieves</i>.<br><br>In <i>Follow the Story,</i> bestselling author and journalist James B. Stewart teaches you the techniques of compelling narrative writing, from nonfiction books to articles, feature stories, or memoirs. Stewart provides concrete directions for conceiving, reporting, structuring, and writing nonfiction&#x2014;techniques that he has used in his own successful books and stories. By using examples from his own work, Stewart illustrates systematically a way of thinking about and executing stories, a method that has helped numerous reporters and Columbia students become better writers. <br><br><i>Follow the Story</i> examines in detail: <br> <ul> <li>How an idea is conceived </li> <li>How to &#x201c;sell&#x201d; ideas to editors and publishers </li> <li>How to report the nonfiction story </li> <li>Six models that can be used for any nonfiction story </li> <li>How to structure the narrative story </li> <li>How to write introductions, endings, dialogue, and description </li> <li>How to introduce and develop characters </li> <li>How to use literary devices </li> <li>Pitfalls to avoid </li></ul> <br> <br>Learn from this book a clear way of looking at the world with the alert curiosity that is the first indispensable step toward good writing.</p><p>Forget everything you thought you knew about journalism. James B. Stewart shuns pyramid style and all its accoutrements for a more creative type of nonfiction, nonfiction that tells a compelling story. Stewart's ideas about nonfiction stem directly from his experience as a writer and editor of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>'s lengthy page-1 feature stories, which explore subjects, as Stewart says, "in depth, with style, and often ... with wit." "Good writing," Stewart says in <i>Follow the Story</i>, "is rooted not in knowledge, but in curiosity." Curiosity too, says Stewart, "is what make readers read the stories that result." Using examples from his own writing (for the <i>Journal</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and <i>SmartMoney</i>, and also from his books Blood Sport and Den of Thieves), the Pulitzer Prize-winning Stewart shows how to turn your curiosity into ideas, story proposals, and then the stories themselves. Each part of the writing process-- cultivating sources, gathering information, writing the lead and the transition, structuring your piece, and then concluding it--is discussed with authority and demonstrated masterfully. Stewart also includes chapters on how to use (but not overuse) description, dialogue, anecdotes, humor, and pathos to strengthen your work. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>James B.

This lively and richly illustrated book investigates the influence of oriental trade and travel on medieval Venice and its architecture.<br><br> Architectural historian Deborah Howard examines the experiences of Venetian merchants overseas, focusing on links with Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, as well as with Persia and the Silk Route. She argues that many Venetians gained insight into Islamic culture through personal contacts with their Muslim trading partners. Based on wide-ranging multidisciplinary research, this book examines the mechanisms that governed the exchange of visual culture across ideological boundaries before the age of printing. Howard explores a range of building types that reflect the impact of Islamic imagery, paying special attention to two icon buildings, San Marco and the Palazzo Ducale. She considers the complexities of importing Muslim ideas to an unambiguously Christian city, itself the point of embarkation for pilgrims to the Holy Land.</p></p><p>Deborah Howard is reader in architectural history at the University of Cambridge and fellow of St. John&#39;s College, Cambridge, England.

Now, after a fateful encounter with a mysterious woman named Morgan, biology has become, literally, Cal's life.<p>Cal was infected by a parasite that has a truly horrifying effect on its host. Cal himself is a carrier, unchanged by the parasite, but he's infected the girlfriends he's had since Morgan. All three have turned into the ravening ghouls Cal calls Peeps.

It's Cal's job to hunt them down before they can create more of their kind. . . .</p><p>Bursting with the sharp intelligence and sly humor that are fast becoming his trademark, Scott Westerfeld's novel is an utterly original take on an archetype of horror.</p></p><p>Scott Westerfeld lives in New York, New York and Sydney, Australia.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 9 Up&#x2013;Vampire stories are a staple of the publishing industry. They are usually romantic and sexy, steeped in a dreamy magic. <i>Peeps</i> is none of those&#x2013;well, maybe a little sexy. Nineteen-year-old Cal, a Texas transplant, lost his virginity&#x2013;and a lot more&#x2013;when he first arrived in New York City. He became a parasite-positive, or peep&#x2013;he prefers not to use the v-word. Now he works for the Night Watch, a secret branch of city government dedicated to tracking others of his kind. Unlike the rare natural carriers like Cal, who has acquired night vision, superhuman strength, and a craving for lots of protein, most peeps are insane cannibals lurking in darkness. But now the teen has found the young woman who infected him&#x2013;and learns that something worse than peeps is threatening the city, and he is on the front lines. Cal's voice is genuine&#x2013;he's a little geeky, as evidenced by the intermittent discussions on parasites, and he laces a dry humor through this immensely reasonable biological vampire story. The evocation of NYC is exactly right, so that even the most fantastic elements of the plot feel believable. Much of the story is concerned with Cal's detective work and growing relationship with Lace, his Major Revelation Incident (he tells her his secret); toward the end, the action picks up in a race to reveal the horrors to come. This innovative and original vampire story, full of engaging characters and just enough horror without any gore, will appeal to a wide audience.<i>&#x2013;Karyn N.

It is the story of a young man named Eric Marshall who goes to teach a school on Prince Edward Island and meets Kilmeny, a mute girl who has perfect hearing. He sees her when he is walking through an old orchard and hears her playing the violin. He visits her a number of times and gradually falls in love with her. When he proposes she rejects him, even though she loves him in return, believing that her disability will only hinder his life if they were married, despite his protests that it wouldn't matter at all. Meanwhile, Eric's good friend David who is a renowned throat doctor, comes to the island and visits Eric. He examines Kilmeny, and says that nothing will cure her but an extreme psychological need to speak. This need comes soon when Neil Gordon, who is Kilmeny's brother and madly jealous of Eric, comes behind Eric with an axe, meaning to kill him. Kilmeny is nearby, and without thinking, she yells to Eric to look behind him: she can now speak. Neil runs away on a ship, and Kilmeny and Eric get married.</p></p><p>When twenty-four-year-old Eric Marshall arrives on Prince Edward Island to become a substitute schoolmaster, he has a bright future in his wealthy family&#39;s business. Eric has taken the two-month teaching post only as a favor to a friend -- but fate throws in his path a beautiful, mysterious girl named Kilmeny Gordon. With jet black hair and sea blue eyes, Kilmeny immediately captures Eric&#39;s heart. But Kilmeny cannot speak, and Eric is concerned for and bewitched by this shy, sensitive mute girl. For the first time in his life Eric must work hard for something he wants badly. And there is nothing he wants more than for Kilmeny to return his love.Lucy Maud Montgomery was one of the most famous Canadian writers of the twentieth century.

His reflections are written in a style that both entertains and disconcerts, as they engage us in topics ranging from moral relativism to the relationship between cultural and psychological differences, from the diversity and tension among activist faiths to "ethnic conflict" in today's politics.</p><br><p> Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism. <i>Available Light</i> offers insightful discussions of concepts such as nation, identity, country, and self, with a reminder that like symbols in general, their meanings are not categorically fixed but grow and change through time and place.</p><br><p> This book treats the reader to an analysis of the American intellectual climate by someone who did much to shape it. One can read Available Light both for its revelation of public culture in its dynamic, evolving forms and for the story it tells about the remarkable adventures of an innovator during the "golden years" of American academia.</p></p><p><b>Clifford Geertz</b> published his famous work, <i>The Interpretation of Cultures</i>, in 1973.

Since the 1970s, it has been closely associated with a sweeping change around the world&#x2015;the "market turn." This is what Avner Offer and Gabriel S�derberg call the rise of market liberalism, a movement that, seeking to replace social democracy, holds up buying and selling as the norm for human relations and society. Our confidence in markets comes from economics, and our confidence in economics is underpinned by the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was first awarded in 1969. Was it a coincidence that the market turn and the prize began at the same time? <i>The Nobel Factor</i>, the first book to describe the origins and power of the most important prize in economics, explores this and related questions by examining the history of the prize, the history of economics since the prize began, and the simultaneous struggle between market liberals and social democrats in Sweden, Europe, and the United States.</p><p><i>The Nobel Factor</i> tells how the prize, created by the Swedish central bank, emerged from a conflict between central bank orthodoxy and social democracy. The aim was to use the halo of the Nobel brand to enhance central bank authority and the prestige of market-friendly economics, in order to influence the future of Sweden and the rest of the developed world. And this strategy has worked, with sometimes disastrous results for societies striving to cope with the requirements of economic theory and deregulated markets.</p><p>Drawing on previously untapped Swedish national bank archives and providing a unique analysis of the sway of prizewinners, <i>The Nobel Factor</i> offers an unprecedented account of the real-world consequences of economics&#x2015;and its greatest prize.</p></p><p><p>"An illuminating and sometimes astonishing book that throws new light on the rise of the new right and the assault on the intellectual underpinning of social democracy. Lateral thinking at its very best--a must-read."<b>--Will Hutton, author of <i>The State We're In</i></b></p><p>"I love this book. It's beautifully written, but more importantly, it manages to combine a sociology of the Nobel Prize in Economics with a genealogy of market liberalism and a history of Sweden's struggle over social democracy. This is difficult enough to imagine, let alone make work, and the authors should be applauded for doing so."<b>--Mark Blyth, author of <i>Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea</i></b></p><p>"At last, two scholars, profoundly versed in the theory, evidence, and history of contemporary economics, puncture the mythology that is the foundation of free-market neoclassical economics. Economics is not science but one policy voice among many others. As Offer and S�derberg document, the pretense of an objective, scientifically based Nobel Prize in Economics has been an artifice of neoliberal propaganda for decades, doing deliberate damage to social democracy. They give a hearing to all sides, and in the end say it like it is. The influence of economics matters a lot and too much of it is sheer theory without evidence."<b>--Jeff Madrick, author of <i>Seven Bad Ideas: How Mainstream Economists Have Damaged America and the World</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Nobel Factor</i> is a tour de force account of how the discipline of economics has developed since the 1960s. Using the Nobel Prize in Economics as their prism, Offer and S�derberg present a refreshingly unapologetic, deeply critical analysis of the ideological turn to market fundamentalism that was propelled by the selection of prizewinners. The authors' analysis of the policy implications makes one question whether economics, as it is generally taught, promotes a healthy economy."<b>--Bo Rothstein, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"<i>The Nobel Factor</i> is a fascinating book. It argues that the Nobel Prize in Economics played a role in the transition from social democracy to market liberalism, in both Sweden and the wider world. This is a new idea that should be of wide interest."<b>--Roger E. Backhouse, author of <i>The Puzzle of Modern Economics: Science or Ideology?</i></b></p><b>Avner Offer</b> is Chichele Professor Emeritus of Economic History at the University of Oxford and a fellow of All Souls College and the British Academy.

But in the tiny town of Appalachian, Ohio, a small group of engineers under the guidance of a visionary eccentric named William Beale is challenging that conventional wisdom in an audacious attempt to transform the way the world makes and uses energy. Their &#34;ultimate machine&#34; - a solar-powered Stirling engine - resembles nothing the world has ever seen, and it carries an enormous burden of hope for the future of the planet. Should they succeed, a patch of desert 170 miles square could generate all the energy needs of the United States virtually pollution-free. Mark Shelton&#39;s exciting narrative takes us inside the laboratories and engine shops of Sunpower, Inc., where Beale and his colleagues are harnessing space-age technology to an idea as old as the steam engine. A working prototype of the Stirling engine is already capable of running an individual house, but enormous obstacles remain: lack of funding, and the preference of the American public and private sectors for getting their energy the good old-fashioned way. Like Tracy Kidder&#39;s Soul of a New Machine, Shelton&#39;s insightful account has the inherent drama of a report from the frontier, a frontier that might well produce the next great technological advance for the human race.The story of the hoped-for use of the sun to fill the world's energy needs by way of Stirling engines that convert heat into power and send it out over the already existing grid of power lines. Shelton wrote 1989's lively Working in a Very Small Place: The Making of a Neurosurgeon. The romance of engineering has never been more intriguingly presented than in Shelton's survey of the engineer-idealists who, battling scientific inertia and the deaf ears turned toward their ideas, are determined to save the world by harnessing the sun's power. The guiding genius behind Sunpower, Inc.--one of a handful of rival research-and-development groups bent on making the laws of thermodynamics work for all humankind--is benign monomaniac William T. Beale, whose White Whale is the sun. Beale heads his R&amp;D group in tiny Athens, Ohio, where Shelton followed him around for two years. Two of Beale's main jobs, among many, are to attract funding and to translate theories into hardware. He must also leap over hardware already in place and powered by oil, big dams, and so on. It's not easy to persuade the United States to build a 170-square- mile complex of Stirling engines in the Arizona desert that, Beale contends, would satisfy the entire country's power needs. Nor is it easy to make people believe that every appliance in every household can be powered by a simple box in the cellar. Stirling engines could potentially eliminate the burning of fossil fuels, save the ozone layer, and shrink the greenhouse effect, among many other ecological goods. What is a Stirling engine? It is an adaptable device that, unlike the internal combustion engine, turns external heat from a continuous heat source into mechanical energy. Intellectually ravishing, while raising the question of whether the fantasy of a solar-powered world will resolve into a future fact. (Photos--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A Raisin in the SunNo Bio</p><h2>Hall of Mirrors: The Great Depression, the Great Recession, and the Uses-and Misuses-of History</h2><p>The two great financial crises of the past century are the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession, which began in 2008. Both occurred against the backdrop of sharp credit booms, dubious banking practices, and a fragile and unstable global financial system. When markets went into cardiac arrest in 2008, policymakers invoked the lessons of the Great Depression in attempting to avert the worst. While their response prevented a financial collapse and catastrophic depression like that of the 1930s, unemployment in the U.S. and Europe still rose to excruciating high levels. Pain and suffering were widespread. <br><br>The question, given this, is why didn't policymakers do better? <em>Hall of Mirrors</em>, Barry Eichengreen's monumental twinned history of the two crises, provides the farthest-reaching answer to this question to date. Alternating back and forth between the two crises and between North America and Europe, Eichengreen shows how fear of another Depression following the collapse of Lehman Brothers shaped policy responses on both continents, with both positive and negative results. Since bank failures were a prominent feature of the Great Depression, policymakers moved quickly to strengthen troubled banks. But because derivatives markets were not important in the 1930s, they missed problems in the so-called shadow banking system. Having done too little to support spending in the 1930s, governments also ramped up public spending this time around. But the response was indiscriminate and quickly came back to haunt overly indebted governments, particularly in Southern Europe. Moreover, because politicians overpromised, and because their measures failed to stave off a major recession, a backlash quickly developed against activist governments and central banks. Policymakers then prematurely succumbed to the temptation to return to normal policies before normal conditions had returned. The result has been a grindingly slow recovery in the United States and endless recession in Europe.<br><br><em>Hall of Mirrors</em> is both a major work of economic history and an essential exploration of how we avoided making only some of the same mistakes twice. It shows not just how the "lessons" of Great Depression history continue to shape society's response to contemporary economic problems, but also how the experience of the Great Recession will permanently change how we think about the Great Depression.<br></p><p><br><strong>Barry Eichengreen</strong> is Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

Reading Hall of Mirrors is a joy. Keeping it on your bookshelf for future reference is a necessity."--Alan Blinder, author of <em>After the Music Stopped</em><p></p><br>"Historical analogies come cheap, but historical insight relevant to today is both rare and valuable. Barry Eichengreen's <em>Hall of Mirrors</em> is packed with the essential insights that give the reader understanding of the macro policy mistakes of the 1930s and the 2000s, both why they occurred and how devastating they were. A must-read." --Adam S. Posen, President, Peterson Institute for International Economics<p></p><br>"Much of modern economics has ignored the study of economic history. Barry Eichengreen's <em>Hall of Mirrors</em> shows why that is a huge mistake. Combining fascinating narrative detail with cogent analysis of the relevant theory, it illuminates crucial parallels and differences between the causes of and policy response to the Great Depression and the Great Recession. It illustrates how good historical analysis must inform current policy choices, but also how superficial historic analogy can lead us astray. It carries powerful implications for the policies still needed to drive continued recovery from the Great Recession, and to stop us repeating in future the mistakes which led to disaster in the past." --Adair Turner, Senior Fellow, Institute for New Economic Thinking<p></p><br>"Eichengreen the economist joined forces with Eichengreen the historian to produce a truly unique book that revisits the past in the light of current discussions and examines present issues in the light of past experience. Eichengreen demonstrates forcefully how important-but also how difficult-it is to learn from history. A must-read for all students of the global crisis but also for everyone interested in understanding why experience is no guarantee against policy errors." --Jean Pisani-Ferry, Professor, Hertie School of Governance (Berlin) and Commissioner-General for Policy Planning (Paris)<p></p><br>"A powerful plus �a change vibe courses through [Eichengreen's] comparison, as he discusses each era's major players and events--e.g., the grifters (Charles Ponzi vs. Bernie Madoff), the reparative legislation (Glass-Steagall Act vs. Dodd-Frank), the economic advisers (FDR's brains trust vs. Obama's team), the institutional collapses (Union Guardian Trust vs. Lehman Brothers) the bubbles (the Florida land boom vs. the subprime mortgage loans), the panicked electorate and the nervous politicians. Eichengreen leavens his wide-angle treatment of complex issues-he devotes almost equal time to economic developments in Europe during each era--with capsule portraits of the major players, with becoming modesty about his own assessments (notwithstanding his obvious intellect) and even with occasional humor." -- <em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"[A] rollicking, villain-rich story contrasting then and now." -- <em>The Atlantic</em><p></p><br>"<em>Hall of Mirrors</em> is destined to change the way we think about both the Great Depression and the Great Recession.

Eichengreen is one of the most prolific economic historians writing today. He is also among the most astute. The author of books on the gold standard, European unification, and the international monetary system, Eichengreen approaches his subject from a thoroughly international perspective, detailing how the crisis spread and showing how containment efforts stumbled on the mismatch between a highly integrated global financial system and a regulatory system dominated by national political concerns." -- <em>Strategy + Business</em><p></p><br>"<em>Hall of Mirrors</em> is written in the past tense, for much of what it discusses is before today. But it is really a present tense book, for the resolution of the 2008 crisis is not done, just postponed. Credit pyramids are ever more imaginative, ever taller. The remaining dilemma is just this: Can commercial banks and investment banks, bank regulators and central bankers be trusted when the rewards for skirting the rules - the massive bonuses, the revolving doors between central and commercial banks, and the guarantee of bailouts by government - are so handsome? Eichengreen's answer is no. That is the implicit point in Hall of Mirrors, which shows with analytical force and elegant prose that the financial systems of the U.S. and other countries remain skewed to protect those who take from the many to reward the few." -- <em>Financial Post</em><p></p><br>"Barry Eichengreen is an ideal scholar to reflect upon both crises, together and separately . . . On equally firm footing discussing events in Europe and the United States and ranging effortlessly, expertly, and impressively across decades and continents, Hall of Mirrors earns a prominent place among the first rank of the many books that have been written in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 . . . <em>Hall of Mirrors</em> works through the current crisis with dexterity and acumen. If anything, the book is more riveting, and even more convincing, when engaging the current crisis." -- <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"This fine book -- a fascinating read for the historically-minded -- reviews in detail the story of the Great Depression and its remarkable parallels with the crises of the last decade . . . Eichengreen ingeniously interweaves the two episodes, rather than treating them separately, making manifest the similarities and differences, both in market developments and in official reactions." -- <em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"[B]rilliantly conceived, and written, as a dual-track account. It is full of wit, and wisdom of course . . . The book is replete with masterstrokes . . . The Introduction and the Conclusion should be bound together and dropped from airplanes on European capitals." -- <em>International Affairs</em><p></p><br>"Both the breadth and depth of Eichengreen's research are impressive. Whether it is the house bubble in Florida in the 1920s or in Spain in the 2000s, the gold standard in the 1930s or the euro in the 2010s, not a single relevant story is left out." -- <em>International Affairs</em><p></p><br>"Eichengreen moves with assurance and elan through a century of US and European economic history to show the delusions of which humans are capable (and the power of finance capital lobbying) as they convince themselves that this time it really will be different." --Roger Middleton, <em>Economic History</em> <em>Review</em><p></p><br>"[Barry Eichengreen] does, however, provide the clearest, best developed history of the economics of the paroxysmal asset-value crashes of 1929-30 and the Great Depression, long thought to be among the sequelae of the First World War and the toxic seeds of the Second. His new book strengthens this argument and clarifies the mechanisms of generation and connection. This is its principal relevance to military history." - William D.

Grant. It set a pattern for warfare not only in the Mississippi Valley but at Fort Donelson and Shiloh as well. Grant's 7 November 1861 strike against the Southern forces at Belmont, in southeastern Missouri on the Mississippi River, made use of the newly outfitted Yankee timberclads and all the infantry available at the staging area in Cairo, Illinois.<br><br>The Confederates, led by Leonidas Polk and Gideon Pillow, had the advantages of position and superior numbers. They hoped to smash Grant's expeditionary force on the Missouri shore and cut off the escape of the Illinois and Iowa troops from their boats. The confrontation was a bloody, all-day fight that a veteran of a dozen major battles would later call "frightful to contemplate." At first successful, the Federals were eventually driven from the field and withdrew up the Mississippi to safety. The battle cost some twenty percent of his troops, but as a result of this engagement Grant became known as an audacious fighting general.<br><br>Using diaries and letters of participants, official documents, and contemporary newspaper accounts, Nathaniel Hughes provides the only full-length tactical study of the battle that catapulted Grant into prominence. Throughout the narrative, Hughes draws sketches of the lives and fates of individual soldiers who fought on both sides, especially of the colorful and enormously dissimilar principal actors, Grant and Polk.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"The most complete account yet of this little-studied battle. . . .

The result is an atypical take on Vincent van Gogh that avoids putting too much stress on his troubled mental state and too much straining by the editor to shape a narrative out of van Gogh&#39;s epistolary clues. Instead, we see the thoughtful and contemplative side of this creative genius, as well as his concern for the impact his art and life had on those people closest to him.<b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b> (1853-1890) was born in Holland. He became an assistant with an international firm of art-dealers and in 1881 he went to Brussels to study art. After an unsuccessful love affair with his cousin he returned to Holland and in 1885 he painted his first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters, a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later his brother Theo, an art dealer, enabled him to study in Paris, where he met Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat, who became very important influences on his work.<br><br>In 1888 he left Paris for the Proven�al landscape at Arles, the subject of many of his best works, including "Sunflowers" and "The Chair and the Pipe." It was here Van Gogh cut off his ear, in remorse for threatening Gauguin with a razor during a quarrel, and he was placed in an asylum for a year. On July 7, 1890 Van Gogh shot himself at the scene of his last painting, the foreboding "Cornfields with Flight of Birds," and he died two days later.<br><br><b>Ronald de Leeuw</b> has been the director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 1986.

Constance nurses him and tries to be the dutiful wife. However, childless and listless she feels oppressed by their marriage and their isolated life. Partly encouraged by Clifford to seek a lover, she embarks on a passionate affair with the gamekeeper, Mellors. Through their liaison Lawrence explores the complications of sex, love and class.<br><br>Written in 1928 and subsequently banned, <b>Lady Chatterley's Lover </b>is one of the most subversive novels in English Literature.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous of Lawrence's novels, the 1928 <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> is no longer distinguished for the once-shockingly explicit treatment of its subject matter--the adulterous affair between a sexually unfulfilled upper-class married woman and the game keeper who works for the estate owned by her wheelchaired husband. Now that we're used to reading about sex, and seeing it in the movies, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful and lyrical writer, whose story takes us bodily into the world of its characters.The Cambridge edition of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover is the first ever to restore to Lawrence&#39;s most famous novel the words that he wrote. Removing corruptions and errors and including hundreds of new words, phrases and sentences - this is the only text that can be read or quoted with confidence.</p><h2>Exegetical Gems from Biblical Hebrew: A Refreshing Guide to Grammar and Interpretation</h2><p>After spending countless hours studying Hebrew vocabulary, paradigms, and grammar, students may wonder how they can begin to reap the rewards of their hard work.

Although this vision was eclipsed for a time by the rise of air travel and trucking, railroads have enjoyed a rebirth in recent years as profitable freight carriers.<br><br>A fascinating account of the rise, decline, and rebirth of railroads in the United States, John F. Stover's <i>American Railroads</i> traces their history from the first lines that helped eastern seaports capture western markets to today's newly revitalized industry. Stover describes the growth of the railroads' monopoly, with the consequent need for state and federal regulations; relates the vital part played by the railroads during the Civil War and the two World Wars; and charts the railroads' decline due to the advent of air travel and trucking during the 1950s.<br><br>In two new chapters, Stover recounts the remarkable recovery of the railroads, along with other pivotal events of the industry's recent history. During the 1960s declining passenger traffic and excessive federal regulation led to the federally-financed creation of Amtrak to revive passenger service and Conrail to provide freight service on bankrupt northeastern railroads. The real savior for the railroads, though, proved to be the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which brought prosperity to rail freight carriers by substantially deregulating the industry. By 1995, renewed railroad freight traffic had reached nearly twice its former peak in 1944.<br><br>Bringing both a seasoned eye and new insights to bear on one of the most American of industries, Stover has produced the definitive history of railroads in the United States.</p><p></p><h2>The Development of Logic</h2><p>Hardback, ex-library, with usual stamps and markings, in fair all round condition suitable as a study copy.

But by 1798, the once-dazzling young republic of the United States was on the verge of collapse: partisanship gripped the weak federal government, British seizures threatened American goods and men on the high seas, and war with France seemed imminent as its own democratic revolution deteriorated into terror. Suddenly, the First Amendment, which protected harsh commentary of the weak government, no longer seemed as practical. So that July, President John Adams and the Federalists in control of Congress passed an extreme piece of legislation that made criticism of the government and its leaders a crime punishable by heavy fines and jail time. In <i>Liberty&#x2019;s First Crisis</i>, writer Charles Slack tells the story of the 1798 Sedition Act, the crucial moment when high ideals met real-world politics and the country&#x2019;s future hung in the balance.<br><br>From a loudmouth in a bar to a firebrand politician to Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s own grandson, those victimized by the Sedition Act were as varied as the country&#x2019;s citizenry. But Americans refused to let their freedoms be so easily dismissed: they penned fiery editorials, signed petitions, and raised liberty poles,&#x201d; while Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison drew up the infamous Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, arguing that the Federalist government had gone one step too far. <i>Liberty&#x2019;s First Crisis</i> vividly unfolds these pivotal events in the early life of the republic, as the Founding Fathers struggled to define America off the page and preserve the freedoms they had fought so hard to create.</p><p>Charles Slack is the critically acclaimed author of three previous nonfiction books, including &#34;Hetty: The Genius and Madness of America s First Female Tycoon&#34; and &#34;Noble Obsession: Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock, and the Race to Unlock the Greatest Industrial Secret of the Nineteenth Century.&#34; He works for Time Inc. in New York and lives in Connecticut with his wife and their daughters.&#34;<b>Praise for <i>Liberty's First Crisis</i></b><br><br> Just a few years after the 1791 adoption of the First Amendment . . . the Federalists in the John Adams administration felt sufficiently threatened by their opposition that they passed the so-called Sedition Act of 1798, placing limits on scandalous and malicious&#x2019; writings or utterances against the government. In <i>Liberty&#x2019;s First Crisis</i> author Charles Slack revisits that nearly forgotten episode with storytelling flair and a keen eye for the latter-day implications of this early challenge to one of the country&#x2019;s bedrock principles. . . . In lucid English, Slack mounts a strong case against the contemporary inclination to legislate against speech that might offend.&#x201d;<b> <i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br> Slack does more than just tell the story of the Sedition Act and the political crisis it created; he recasts the story as a chapter in a larger narrative about the philosophical right to be heard even when the opinion offered proves unpopular or even dangerous. . . . The lesson seems clear from Slack&#x2019;s well-written and well-researched work: Free speech and free expression don&#x2019;t have to be respected by society, but they must always be protected by law.&#x201d;<b> <i>Dallas Morning News</i></b><br><br> Artfully tells the story of the rise and eventual fall of the Sedition Act. . . . Slack&#x2019;s delightful narrative focuses not on Adams and Jefferson but on the vast and eccentric group of printers, orators, politicians, amateur philosophers and visionaries who fought against the Sedition Act. . . . [He] shows us how citizens . . . gave the First Amendment its defining role in American politics.&#x201d;<b> <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></b><br><br> Slack reminds us that the free speech we too often take for granted is in constant jeopardy, most often from those who see the forced silence of others as an acceptable path to equity, tranquility and security.&#x201d;<b> <i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i></b><br><br> A real gripping thriller . . . Vibrant, exciting.&#x201d;<b> Ralph Nader, Ralph Nader Radio Hour&#x201d;</b><br><br> Among its other virtues, <i>Liberty&#x2019;s First Crisis</i> presents several healthy reminders that elected officials have always been capable of uncivilized behavior toward their colleagues . . . Slack has written a hearty work of history that is entertaining, educational, and serious about its topic without being so much so in tone.&#x201d;<b> <i>Arts Fuse</i></b><br><br> For those who think that partisan conflict is a cable-driven 21st-century phenomenon, Charles Slack has written a powerful and engaging narrative that puts things in perspective. By plunging back into the 1790s, Slack brings one of America&#x2019;s defining crises back to vivid life, reminding us that democracy has always been the tenderest of flowers. This is a terrific piece of history.&#x201d;<b> Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Thomas Jefferson</i></b><br><br> Fantastic characters, vibrant storytelling and a hugely important message for our time. When I reached the last page, I wanted to stand up and applaud. Slack&#x2019;s heroes took up residence in my imagination, where I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll remain. I will be recommending this book far and wide.&#x201d;<b> William Powers, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Hamlet&#x2019;s Blackberry</i></b><br><br> Charles Slack has taken a half-forgotten chapter in American history and made it into a legal thriller with profound implications for our own time. With meticulous research and compelling prose, Slack&#x2019;s dramatic narrative, ranging from the halls of Congress to fetid jail cells, reveals how the powerful sought to throttle one of our most cherished freedoms. He also warns that the threat persists. From the Founding to this day, liberty is a fragile thing indeed.&#x201d;<b> Henry Wiencek, award-winning author of <i>Master of the Mountain: Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves</i></b><br><br> Slack engagingly reveals how the Federalist attack on the First Amendment almost brought down the Republic. . . . An illuminating book of American history.&#x201d;<b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)</b><br><br> A lively account of a relatively unknown episode in American history. . . . Slack&#x2019;s book will appeal to history lovers of all kinds.&#x201d;<b> <i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br> Imagine a novel in which a band of hard-drinking, street-fighting, badass rebels take on the rulers of a powerful new empire, risking everything in a struggle that will determine the fate of American freedom. Then imagine that it's not a work of fiction but the history of the early United States and that the villains attempting to impose a tyrannical regime on Americans were some of our greatest national heroes. Present this riveting, little-known, but painfully relevant story in the prose of a master storyteller and you have Charles Slack's <i>Liberty's First Crisis</i>.&#x201d;<b> Thaddeus Russell, author of <i>A Renegade History of the United State</i></b><br><br> This is a story about the true meaning of freedom, how America&#x2019;s founding fathers wrestled over it, and how it nearly slipped through their (and our) grasp. Deeply researched and cogently analyzed, Charles Slack&#x2019;s <i>Liberty&#x2019;s First Crisis</i> molds the dramatic events swirling around the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 into a mesmerizing, uniquely American tale complete with fistfights, insults, canings, and rigged courts. Most importantly, it underscores the high-minded reasoning, the courage, the sacrifice needed to achieve that most fleeting and invaluable of human conditions: freedom. Slack has created an indelible story. To read it is to better understand why America is still a concept worth loving and fighting for.

A major influence on Queer Theory and gender studies (he was openly gay and died of an AIDS-related illness in 1984), he also wrote on architecture, history, law, medicine, literature, politics, and of course philosophy. He even managed to write a best seller in France on a book dedicated to the history of systems of thought. Because he never succinctly stated his arguments, those trying to come to terms with Foucault's work have desperately sought introductory material to make his theories clear and accessible for the beginner.<br><br>Here, Gary Gutting presents a comprehensive but non-systematic treatment of some highlights of Foucault's life and thought. The book begins with a brief biography to set the social and political stage. It then considers Foucault's thoughts on literature, in particular the avant-garde scene, his philosophical and historical work and the reception he received from the historical community, his treatment of knowledge and power in modern society, and his thoughts on sexuality.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Lonoff (expository writing, Harvard) here collects the sisters' 28 extant devoirs, presenting each in its original French with English translation on the facing page. To demonstrate the powerful effect of teacher upon pupil, Lonoff reproduces Heger's comments on the sisters' essays and their responses. She also provides an excellent introduction and crisp commentary on each devoir that draw in vivid detail the biographical, historical, and literary context of this crucial period of the sisters' artistic development.

Instead, you can incorporate parts of the program into your daily routine&#x2014;make the needed dietary changes, reward successful pooping with stickers, and consider reviewing how poops come out of the body. Most 5- to 6-year-olds are interested in doing the full program, though it is still important to be flexible.

Brick-and-mortar has shifted to online, while online is shifting into pop-up storefronts. Virtual stores in subway platforms and airports are offering new levels of convenience for harried commuters.

Tour.</p><p>Fifty years of FBI/CIA bureaucratic friction stem from their very different missions, law enforcement versus foreign intelligence gathering. Author Riebling narrates in exhaustive detail the feud's origin between J. Edgar Hoover and "Wild Bill" Donovan and brings the conflict up to the continuing fallout of the Aldrich Ames spy scandal. In episodes over the decades, Riebling relates how the two agencies have repeatedly butted heads in the area of counterintelligence, mainly because the FBI likes to arrest traitors and foreign agents with dispatch, while the CIA prefers to string out cases as far into the wilderness of mirrors as possible, the better, in theory, to unmask deep-penetrating moles. Hence the two organizations have tried numerous liaison methods, which sometimes worked and sometimes produced convoluted careers like that of James Angleton, recounted in umpteen titles (e.g., <i>Molehunt</i>, 1992, by David Wise) since the revelations of the 1970s. In part, Riebling reworks revealed material, but he does bring forth new angles, thanks to his entr{&#x201a;}ee to a web of retired agents. However, blemishes appear in the otherwise sober work: speculative conclusions (that FBI/CIA conflict caused Watergate and JFK's death); a mistake, intentional or inadvertent, that has Nixon using Haldeman's words in the infamous "smoking gun" tape of June 23, 1972; and the failure to incorporate in his account the testimony of eyewitness O. Kalugin (<i>The First Directorate</i> ) that would have filled out his account of the CIA blowing an agent whom the KGB kidnappped and killed in 1975. Withal, a well-organized, engaging account. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i>Based on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and interviews with former agents, Riebling's expose of the bitter rivalry between the FBI and CIA is presented through the prism of national traumas that might have turned out differently had these agencies worked togther: the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the McCarthy-era loyalty investigations, the JFK assassination and the World Trade Center bombing. Relations have always been tense, shows Riebling, dating back to the early years of WWII when William Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of the CIA), built a network of agents against the wishes of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Interagency animosity was further fueled by Hoover's suspicion that a later CIA director, Walter Bedell Smith, was a Communist. The FBI's obsessive search for Soviet moles during the '60s led to a formal disassociation in 1970, when Hoover abolished the Liaison Section. Relations are still so poor that the recent arraignment of Soviet spy Aldridge Ames was presented to the public, according to the author, less as a national-security catastrophe than as an example of something rare and wonderful-cooperation between the FBI and CIA. Riebling is a former Random House editor; this is his first book. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Anti-Pamela and Shamela</h2><p><p> Published together for the first time, Eliza Haywood&#x2019;s <em>Anti-Pamela</em> and Henry Fielding&#x2019;s <em>An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews</em> are the two most important responses to Samuel Richardson&#x2019;s novel <em>Pamela</em>. <em>Anti-Pamela</em> comments on Richardson&#x2019;s representations of work, virtue, and gender, while also questioning the generic expectations of the novel that <em>Pamela</em> establishes, and it provides a vivid portrayal of the material realities of life for a woman in eighteenth-century London.

Written in Cheryl's signature, heartwarming style, <b>Life Makeovers</b> is the ideal book for anyone looking for a balanced way to reclaim their life one step at a time. <br><br>How often do you daydream about living a better life&#x2014;a life that reflects more of you, your values and deepest desires? How many times have you come to the end of a busy week and toyed with the fantasy of packing abag and leaving it all behind?<br><br>The "<b>Life Makeover</b>" program is a powerful year-long program for change. It is designed to support you in changing your life one week at a time. Each chapter consists of a topic of the week and contains a Take Action Challenge and a Resources section to support you in taking action quickly and easily.<br><br>Be prepared for your life to unfold in wonderful ways. As you clean up the clutter, reconnect with your inner wisdom, strengthen your character, and take on the challenges of high-quality living, you'll find that the lost parts of yourself start to come together to form a pretty amazing life!</p><p>What do you need to change to make your life work better and make you happier? Top-level personal coach Cheryl Richardson, author of the popular <i>Take Time for Your Life</i>, shows you how to make your life over, one week at a time, using her philosophy of "extreme self-care." The result: you'll reevaluate your life and connect to what matters most to you, improving the quality of your life. <p> <i>Life Makeovers</i> is organized into 52 chapters, one for each week of the year. (Procrastinators: don't wait until January 1 to start--just call this week "week 1" and get going.) Each chapter has a specific theme with a "Take Action Challenge": a practical strategy to put a change into action immediately. For example, week 1 encourages you to reflect on what you've done right by writing down your five greatest accomplishments and three ways you've grown in the past year. Week 5 helps you manage your time by creating an "Absolute Yes" list of your five top priorities for the next 3 to 6 months. Week 20 helps identify behaviors that trigger feelings of irritability or frustration with a "I know I'm headed for trouble when..." list and three things you'll put in place to support your self-care when these happen. Additional topics range widely, such as exploring your internal rules and standards, asking for support, improving your sleep, shaking up your daily routine, and sharing with those in need. Each chapter also includes several well-chosen resources for exploring the topic further. </p><p> If you use <i>Life Makeovers</i> as it's designed, you'll have the wisdom and inspiration of one of the best personal coaches in the business for a whole year. You'll have to work with her--no instant magic here--but it will be worth it. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>"Cheryl Richardson is here to guide you on a yearlong personal discovery journey.

This is an extremely difficult book to read because it's such a vivid catalog of pain. But Fry, a bereavement counselor, aims to do more than tell harrowing stories. She also wants to get young people to use their creative talents to ease their emotional turmoil: each of the 11 real-life stories she includes is followed by a selection of reasonable self-help activities--make a trouble doll, stitch a memory quilt, etc. The narratives, from young people ranging in age from toddler to teen, encompass a wide variety of situations. In one, a little boy deals with the death of a pet; in another, a little girl recounts the horrific murder-suicide of her parents. The accounts show the importance of professional counseling as well as the value of helping oneself. Unfortunately, the audience for this book is not clear-cut. The text may be too difficult and the situations too stark for some elementary or middle-school children (to whom many of Fry's self-help activities seem directed), and the chapter readings (presented with no publication information) aren't always age appropriate. For example, Wilson Rawls' <i>Where the Red Fern Grows</i>, an adult book, is suggested reading at the end of the story about a preschool child. Still, Fry captures the cruel legacy of loss while providing a firm statement that, with time and work, the pain will eventually ease.

Cyberpunks are now among the shock troops of postmodernism, Larry McCaffery argues in <i>Storming the Reality Studio, </i>marshalling the resources of a fragmentary culture to create a startling new form. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, multinational machinations, frenetic bursts of prose, collisions of style, celebrations of texture: although emerging largely from science fiction, these features of cyberpunk writing are, as this volume makes clear, integrally related to the aims and innovations of the literary avant-garde. <p></p><p>By bringing together original fiction by well-known contemporary writers (William Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Kathy Acker, J. G. Ballard, Samuel R. Delany), critical commentary by some of the major theorists of postmodern art and culture (Jacques Derrida, Fredric Jameson, Timothy Leary, Jean-Fran�ois Lyotard), and work by major practitioners of cyberpunk (William Gibson, Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, Pat Cadigan, Bruce Sterling), <i>Storming the Reality Studio</i> reveals a fascinating ongoing dialog in contemporary culture.</p><p>What emerges most strikingly from the colloquy is a shared preoccupation with the force of technology in shaping modern life. It is precisely this concern, according to McCaffery, that has put science fiction, typically the province of technological art, at the forefront of creative explorations of our unique age. <br>A rich opporunity for reading across genres, this anthology offers a new perspective on the evolution of postmodern culture and ultimately shows how deeply technological developments have influenced our vision and our art. </p><p><i>Selected Fiction contributors: </i> Kathy Acker, J.

Most of the space goes to the two godfathers of cyberpunk, William Gibson (whose Neuromancer , Berkley, 1984, won the science fiction triple crown--Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick awards) and Bruce Sterling ( Schismatrix , LJ 6/15/85), but most other major cyberpunk writers are represented. McCaffery does not limit cyberpunk to science fiction but puts it in the context of postmodern literature and 1980s popular culture. The only flaw is that Sterling's preface to Mirrorshades ( LJ 12/86), often considered a cyberpunk manifesto and constantly referred to in the essays, is not presented until the end of the nonfiction section.

Disproving the popular thought that primitive life was simple, this monumental survey shows that savage man was enmeshed in a tangle of magic, taboos, and superstitions. Revealed here is the evolution of man from savagery to civilization, from the modification of his weird and often bloodthirsty customs to the entry of lasting moral, ethical, and spiritual values.</p></p><p>Before Joseph Campbell became the world's most famous practitioner of comparative mythology, there was Sir James George Frazer. <i>The Golden Bough</i> was originally published in two volumes in 1890, but Frazer became so enamored of his topic that over the next few decades he expanded the work sixfold, then in 1922 cut it all down to a single thick edition suitable for mass distribution. The thesis on the origins of magic and religion that it elaborates "will be long and laborious," Frazer warns readers, "but may possess something of the charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange lands, with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs." Chief among those customs--at least as the book is remembered in the popular imagination--is the sacrificial killing of god-kings to ensure bountiful harvests, which Frazer traces through several cultures, including in his elaborations the myths of Adonis, Osiris, and Balder.<p> While highly influential in its day, <i>The Golden Bough</i> has come under harsh critical scrutiny in subsequent decades, with many of its descriptions of regional folklore and legends deemed less than reliable. Furthermore, much of its tone is rooted in a philosophy of social Darwinism--sheer cultural imperialism, really--that finds its most explicit form in Frazer's rhetorical question: "If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?" (The truly civilized races, he goes on to say later, though not particularly loudly, are the ones whose minds evolve beyond religious belief to embrace the rational structures of scientific thought.) Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that "primitive" races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that "a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural." And he certainly was not about to make explicit the logical extension of his theories--"that Christian legend, dogma, and ritual" (to quote Robert Graves's summation of Frazer in <i>The White Goddess</i>) "are the refinement of a great body of primitive and barbarous beliefs." Whatever modern readers have come to think of the book, however, its historical significance and the eloquence with which Frazer attempts to develop what one might call a unifying theory of anthropology cannot be denied. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>This greatly revised and enlarged twelve-volume third edition (1911-15) of the controversial work by Sir James Frazer (1854-1941) applies the techniques of comparative ethnography to classical religion. Volumes 10 and 11 (1913) continue to examine taboo behaviour, and consider the role of sunlight and firelight in ritual.</p><h2>The Tin Star</h2><p>When James Killian comes out to his father, he finds himself banished from his home and fired from his job.

Its pages are populated with figures from myth, legend, ancient history, and current events, from Cu Chulainn and Brian Boru to Oliver Cromwell, James Joyce, Lady Gregory, Gerry Adams, and Sinead O'Connor&#x2014;some beloved, some controversial, but all with an undeniable influence on the course of Irish history and in turn, the history of the modern world. McCourt proves an irresistible guide on this vivid tour through the colorful and turbulent history of the Emerald Isle, from the Celtic settlements, through Viking and British occupations, modern troubles and struggle for independence. He also offers fresh insights on the country's cultural contributions to folklore, literature, art, music, and cuisine.</p><p>County Limerick native <b>Malachy McCourt</b> is <i>the</i> authority to tell the history of Ireland. He has written several books, including the best-selling <i>A Monk Swimming</i>, <i>Singing My Him Song</i>, <i>Danny Boy</i>, <i>Voices of Ireland</i>, and <i>The Claddagh Ring</i>. Complementing his literary work, McCourt is also a skilled actor. He appeared in the television series <i>Oz</i> and in feature films such as <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>. He lives in New York City.McCourt (<i>A Monk Swimming</i>) breaks down Ireland's history into 16 sections and, through biographical vignettes, uses famous Irish men and woman to define each epoch. For example, he explores ancient Ireland by profiling the three most prominent Irish saints: Patrick, Brigid and Columcille. Each brief, colloquial sketch provides not only historical background but also colorful conjectures. Moving through history, readers encounter Brian Bor�, the Irish king credited with expelling the Vikings and unifying Ireland; Strongbow, who led the Norman invasion of Ireland; and Hugh O'Neill, who battled Elizabeth for Irish freedom before succumbing in the Battle of Kinsale in 1601. Modern Ireland is represented by the likes of Theobald Wolfe Tone, a member of the (Presbyterian) United Irishmen, who led the unsuccessful revolution of 1798; and Daniel O'Connell, the Liberator, who brought religious freedom to Ireland's Catholics. Of course, modern revolutionary Ireland is represented by Michael Collins and Eamon De Valera, and there are also looks at writers W.B. Yeats and Samuel Beckett. McCourt takes us up to the present with portraits of Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and rock star Bono. Interesting for the neophyte, this volume will be old news for the veteran reader of Irish history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p>Timothy White is the editor in chief of Billboard magazine. Formally senior editor of Rolling Stone magazine.The Beach Boys have come to be considered "America's band," but rock journalist White shows that that appellation is rather an affront to the nation. For the band, originally made up of the three Wilson brothers and a cousin, is nearly the ultimate in dysfunctional families. Its members' troubled personal relationships add poignancy to the story of how leader Brian Wilson turned his idyllic childhood of cars, surf, girls, and sports into fodder for a string of hits celebrating a romantic conception of California. Drawing on his long acquaintance with the Beach Boys and interviews with three generations of the Wilson family, White makes his band chronicle also function as a social history of modern California as he tells how the brothers' grandfather was lured from Kansas by Sunkist advertising and as he interpolates vivid descriptions of California culture into the account of the group's long passage from teen-idol status to played-out oldies vendor. There are already several Beach Boys books, but White's is the best researched and the most insightful on the music and its cultural significance. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Facts Of Life</h2><p>1978 1st Little Brown.

A gripping narrative as well as a portrait of the Zen path and the ways of wildfire, <i>Fire Monks</i> reveals what it means to meet a crisis with full presence of mind.<br><br>Zen master and author of the classic <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i>, Shunryu Suzuki Roshi established a monastery at Tassajara Hot Springs in 1967, drawn to the location's beauty, peace, and seclusion. Deep in the wilderness east of Big Sur, the center is connected to the outside world by a single unpaved road. The remoteness that makes it an oasis also makes it particularly vulnerable when disaster strikes. If fire entered the canyon, there would be no escape.<br><br>More than two thousand wildfires, all started by a single lightning storm, blazed across the state of California in June 2008. With resources stretched thin, firefighters advised residents at Tassajara to evacuate early. Most did. A small crew stayed behind, preparing to protect the monastery when the fire arrived.<br><br>But nothing could have prepared them for what came next. A treacherous shift in weather conditions prompted a final order to evacuate everyone, including all firefighters. As they caravanned up the road, five senior monks made the risky decision to turn back. Relying on their Zen training, they were able to remain in the moment and do the seemingly impossible-to greet the fire not as an enemy to defeat, but as a friend to guide.<br><br><i>Fire Monks</i> pivots on the kind of moment some seek and some run from, when life and death hang in simultaneous view. Novices in fire but experts in readiness, the Tassajara monks summoned both intuition and wisdom to face crisis with startling clarity. The result is a profound lesson in the art of living.</p><p>COLLEEN MORTON BUSCH'S nonfiction, poetry, and fiction have appeared in a wide range of publications, from literary magazines to the <i>San Francisco Chronicle, Tricycle, </i>and <i>Yoga Journal, </i>where she was a senior editor.

The human ability to sympathize forms the psychological basis of man&#x2019;s desire to adhere to natural moral laws. Adam Smith explores ideas about individual freedom and self-interest, conscience and virtue, and a classic work of moral philosophy that remains relevant.</p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) lays the foundation for a general system of morals, and is a text of central importance in the history of moral and political thought. By means of the idea of sympathy and the mental construct of an impartial spectator, Smith formulated highly original theories of conscience, moral judgment and the virtues. This volume offers a new edition of the text with helpful notes for the student reader, together with a substantial introduction that sets the work in its philosophical and historical context.&#34;In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith assigned himself a difficult and dangerous task: to establish for educated men in an increasingly revolutionary age the reasonableness of morality and the necessity of the fruits of virtue - illustrated by the wisdom of the classical authors of antiquity. This book, Adam Smith&#39;s first, is, then, proof to skeptics of the importance of morality; and an antidote to those who think that free-market economics can be divorced from a moral society.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.</p><h2>First Science Encyclopedia (DK First Reference)</h2><p>Bringing young readers into the world of science with gorgeous photography, accessible information, quizzes, fun facts, and more, <i>First Science Encyclopedia</i> is the latest addition to DK's First Reference series, a collection of reference books for children to use at school or home.

In Thailand, rice is grown everywhere&#x2014;and it is almost always a part of every meal. Photographer Richard Sobol invites us on a journey to Thailand to explore the life of rice: from the beginning of the growing season at the Royal Plowing Ceremony, to the hard work of transplanting and harvesting the rice plants, and finally ending with a delicious dinner&#x2014;of rice, of course! Illustrated with beautiful photographs of the farmers and rice fields of Thailand, this is a firsthand account of one of the world&#x2019;s most valuable and important crops.</p><p>Richard Sobol is an award-winning photographer whose work has appeared in numerous national magazines. His children&#x2019;s books include the first in the Traveling Photographer series, BREAKFAST IN THE RAINFOREST: A VISIT WITH MOUNTAIN GORILLAS. He lives in Lexington, Massachusetts.Gr 2-6&#x2013;Turning his lens to the rice fields of Thailand, Sobol begins this affectionate account with a description of the Royal Plowing Ceremony that kicks off the planting season and continues through cultivation and into the harvest. Brief explanations of the growing stages of rice are accompanied by beautiful color photographs of the fields in their various phases. The theme of the book is really the significant role that this grain plays in both the cultural and economic lives of the people. Those wanting an in-depth look at rice production worldwide will need to supplement this book with other titles, but Sobol offers an interesting look at a country and its people, and their relationship to the land. The writing is accessible and lively, providing a unique, specific look at one of the world's most important staples.<i>Jody Kopple, Shady Hill School, Cambridge, MA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

But now, a mysterious energy rift within the mountains of Kalimdor propels three former warriors into the distant past -- a time long before orcs, humans or even high elves roamed the land. A time when the Dark Titan Sargeras, and his demon pawns persuaded Queen Azshara and her Highborne to cleanse Azeroth of its lesser races. A time when the Dragon Aspects were at the height of their power -- unaware that one of their own would soon usher in an age of darkness that would engulf the world of...War Craft�. <br> In the first chapter of this epic trilogy, the outcome of the historic War of the Ancients is forever altered by the arrival of three time-lost heroes: Krasus, the dragon mage whose great power and memories of the ancient conflict have inexplicably diminished; the human wizard Rhonin, whose thoughts are divided between his family and the seductive source of his now-growing power; and Broxigar, a weathered orc veteran who seeks a glorious death in combat. But unless these unlikely allies can convince the demigod, Cenarius, and the untrusting night elves of their queen's treachery, the burning Legion's gateway into Azeroth will open anew. And this time -- the struggles of the past may well spill over into the future...</p><p>Richard A.

When first the vast, walled edifice had been constructed, using magic that melded both stone and forest into a single, cohesive form, it had been a wonder to touch the heart of any who saw it. Its towers were trees strengthened by rock, with jutting spires and high, open windows. The walls were volcanic stone raised up, then bound tightly by draping vines and giant roots. The main palace at the center had originally been created by the mystical binding of more than a hundred giant, ancient trees. Bent in together, they had formed the skeleton of the rounded center, over which the stone and vines had been set.<br><br>A wonder to touch the hearts of all when first it had been built, now it touched the fears of some. An unsettling aura enshrouded it, one heightened this stormy night. The few who peered at the ancient edifice now quickly averted their gaze.<br><br>Those who looked instead to the waters below it found no peace, either. The ebony lake was now in violent, unnatural turmoil. Churning waves as high as the palace rose and fell in the distance, crashing with a roar. Lightning played over its vast body, lightning gold, crimson, or the green of decay. Thunder rumbled like a thousand dragons and those who lived around its shores huddled close, uncertain as to what sort of storm might be unleashed.<br><br>On the walls surrounding the palace, ominous guards in forest-green armor and wielding lances and swords glared warily about. They watched not only beyond the walls for foolish trespassers, but on occasion surreptitiously glanced within...particularly at the main tower, where they sensed unpredictable energies at play.<br><br>And in that high tower, in a stone chamber sealed from the sight of those outside, tall, narrow figures in iridescent robes of turquoise, embroidered with stylized, silver images of nature, bent over a six-sided pattern written into the floor. At the center of the pattern, symbols in a language archaic even to the wielders flared with lives of their own.<br><br>Glittering, silver eyes with no pupils stared out from under the hoods as the night elves muttered the spell. Their dark, violet skin grew covered in sweat as the magic within the pattern amplified. All but one looked weary, ready to succumb to exhaustion. That one, overseeing the casting, watched the process not with silver orbs like the rest, but rather false black ones with streaks of ruby running horizontal along the centers. But despite the false eyes, he noted every detail, every inflection by the others. His long, narrow face, narrow even for an elf, wore an expression of hunger and anticipation as he silently drove them on.<br><br>One other watched all of this, drinking in every word and gesture. Seated on a luxurious chair of ivory and leather, her rich, silver hair framing her perfect features and the silken gown -- as golden as her eyes -- doing the same for her exquisite form, she was every inch the vision of a queen. She leaned back against the chair, sipping wine from a golden goblet. Her jeweled bracelets tinkled as her hand moved and the ruby in the tiara she wore glistened in the light of the sorcerous energies the others had summoned.<br><br>Now and then her gaze shifted ever so slightly to study the dark-eyed figure, her full lips pursing in something approaching suspicion. Yet, when once he suddenly glanced her way, as if sensing her observation, all suspicion vanished, replaced by a languid smile.<br><br>The chanting continued.<br><br>The black lake churned madly.<br><br>There had been a war and it had ended.<br><br>So, Krasus knew, history would eventually record what had happened. Almost lost in that recording would be the countless personal lives destroyed, the lands ravaged, and the near-destruction of the entire mortal world.<br><br><i>Even the memories of dragons are fleeting under such circumstances,</i> the pale, gray-robed figure conceded to himself. He understood that very well, for although to most eyes he resembled a lanky, almost elven figure with hawklike features, silvering hair, and three long scars traveling down his right cheek, he was much more than that. To most, he was known as a wizard, but to a select few he was called <i>Korialstrasz</i> -- a name only a dragon would wear.<br><br>Krasus had been born a dragon, a majestic red one, the youngest of the great Alexstrasza's consorts. She, the Aspect of Life, was his dearest companion...yet once again he dragged himself away from her to study the plights and futures of the short-lived races.<br><br>In the hidden, rock-hewn abode he had chosen for his new sanctum, Krasus looked over the world of Azeroth. The gleaming emerald crystal enabled him to see whatever land, whatever individual, he desired.<br><br>And everywhere that the dragon mage looked, he saw devastation.<br><br>It seemed as if it had only been a few years ago when the grotesque, green-skinned behemoths called orcs, who had invaded the world from beyond, were defeated. With their remaining numbers kept in encampments, Krasus had believed the world ready for peace. Yet, that peace had been short-lived. The Alliance -- the human-led coalition that had been the forefront of the resistance -- had immediately begun to crumble, its members vying for power over one another. Part of that had been the fault of dragons -- or the <i>one</i> dragon, Deathwing -- but much had simply been the greed and desire of humans, dwarves, and elves.<br><br>Yet, even that would have passed with little concern if not for the coming of the Burning Legion.<br><br>Today, Krasus surveyed distant Kalimdor, located on the far side of the sea. Even now, areas of it resembled a land after a terrible volcanic eruption. No life, no semblance of civilization, remained in those areas. It had not been any natural force, however, that had rent the land so. The Burning Legion had left <i>nothing</i> in its wake but death.<br><br>The fiery demons had come from a place beyond reality. Magic was what they sought, magic they devoured. Attacking in conjunction with their monstrous pawns, the Undead Scourge, they had thought to lay waste to the world. Yet, they had not counted on the most unlikely alliance of all...<br><br>The orcs, once also their puppets, had turned on them. They had joined the humans, elves, dwarves, and dragons to decimate the demonic warriors and ghoulish beasts and push the remnants back into the hellish beyond. Thousands had perished, but the alternative...<br><br>The dragon mage snorted. In truth, there had been <i>no</i> alternative.<br><br>Krasus waved long, tapering fingers over the orb, summoning a vision of the orcs. The view blurred momentarily, then revealed a mountainous, rocky area further inland. A harsh land, but one still full of life and capable of supporting the new colonists.<br><br>Already, several stone structures had risen in the main settlement, where the Warchief and one of the heroes of the war, Thrall, ruled. The high, rounded edifice that served as his quarters was crude by the standards of any other race, but orcs had a propensity toward basics. Extravagance to an orc was having a permanent place to live at all. They had been nomads or prisoners for so long that the concept of "home" had been all but lost.<br><br>Several of the massive, greenish figures tilled a field. Watching the tusked, brutish-looking workers, Krasus marveled at the concept of orc farmers. Thrall, however, was a highly unusual orc and he had readily grasped the ideas that would return stability to his people.<br><br>Stability was something the entire world needed badly. With another wave of his hand, the dragon mage dismissed Kalimdor, summoning now a much closer location -- the once proud capital of his favored Dalaran. Ruled by the wizards of the Kirin Tor, the prime wielders of magic, it had been at the forefront of the Alliance's battle against the Burning Legion in Lordaeron and one of the first and most prized targets of the demons in turn.<br><br>Dalaran lay half in ruins. The once-proud spires had been all but shattered. The great libraries burned. Countless generations of knowledge had been lost...and with them countless lives. Even the council had suffered badly. Several of those Krasus had counted as friends or at least respected colleagues had been slain. The leadership was in disarray and he knew that he would have to step in to lend a hand. Dalaran needed to speak with one voice, if only to keep what remained of the splintered Alliance intact.<br><br>Yet, despite the turmoil and tribulations still ahead, the dragon did have hope. The problems of the world were surmountable ones. No more fear of orcs, no more fear of demons. Azeroth would struggle, but in the end, Krasus not only thought it would survive, he fully believed it would thrive.<br><br>He dismissed the emerald crystal and rose. The Dragon Queen, his beloved Alexstrasza, would be awaiting him. She suspected his desire to return to help the mortal world and, of all dragons, she most understood. He would transform to his true self, bid her farewell -- for a time -- and depart before regrets held him back.<br><br>His sanctum he had chosen not only for its seclusion, but also for its massiveness. Stepping from the smaller chamber, Krasus entered a toothy cavern whose heights readily matched the now lost towers of Dalaran. An army could have bivouacked in the cavern and not filled it.<br><br>Just the right size for a dragon.<br><br>Krasus stretched his arms...and as he did, his tapering fingers lengthened further, becoming taloned. His back arched and from near the shoulders erupted twin growths that quickly transformed into fledgling wings. His long features stretched, turning reptilian.<br><br>Throughout all these lesser changes, Krasus's form expanded. He became four, five, even ten times the size of a man and continued to grow. Any semblance to a human or elf quickly faded.<br><br>From wizard, Krasus became Korialstrasz, dragon.<br><br>But -- in the very midst of the transformation -- a desperate voice suddenly filled his head.<br><br><i>Kor...strasz...</i><br><br>He faltered, all but reverting to his wizardly form. Krasus blinked, then stared around the huge chamber as if seeking the source of the cry there.<br><br>Nothing. The dragon mage waited and waited, but the call did not repeat.<br><br>Shrugging it off to his own uncertainties, he commenced again with the transformation -- <br><br>And again, the desperate voice cried <i>Korialstra...</i><br><br>rThis time...he recognized it. Immediately, he responded in kind. <i>I hear you! What is it you need of me?</i><br><br>There was no response, but Krasus sensed the desperation remaining. Focusing, he tried to reach out, establish a link with the one who so badly needed his aid -- the one who should have needed no aid from any creature.<br><br><i>I am here!</i> the dragon mage demanded. <i>Sense me! Give me some indication of what is wrong!</i><br><br>He felt the barest touch in return, a faint hinting of some distress. Krasus concentrated every iota of his thoughts into the meager link, hoping...hoping...<br><br>The overpowering presence of a dragon whose magic dwarfed his own a thousandfold sent Krasus staggering. A sensation of centuries, of great age, engulfed him. Krasus felt as if Time itself now surrounded him in all its terrible majesty.<br><br>Not Time...not quite...but he who was the Aspect of Time.<br><br>The Dragon of the Ages...Nozdormu.<br><br>There were only four great dragons, four Great Aspects, of which his beloved Alexstrasza was Life. Mad Malygos was Magic and ethereal Ysera influenced Dreams. They, along with brooding Nozdormu, represented creation itself.<br><br>Krasus grimaced. In truth, there had been <i>five</i> Aspects. The fifth had once been called Neltharion...the Earth Warder. But long ago, in a time even Krasus could not recall clearly, Neltharion had betrayed his fellows. The Earth Warder had turned on them and in the process had garnered a new, more appropriate title.<br><br>Deathwing. The Destroyer.<br><br>The very thought of Deathwing stirred Krasus from his astonishment. He absently touched the three scars on his cheek. Had Deathwing returned to plague the world again? Was that why the great Nozdormu would show such distress?<br><br><i>I hear you!</i> Krasus mentally called back, now more than ever fearful of the reason for the call. <i>I hear you! Is it -- is it the Destroyer?</i><br><br>But in response, he was once again buffeted by an overwhelming series of astonishing images. The images burnt themselves into his head, making it impossible for Krasus to ever forget any.<br><br>In either form, Krasus, however adaptable and capable, was no match for the unbridled power of an Aspect. The force of the other dragon's mental might flung him back against the nearest wall, where the mage collapsed.<br><br>It took several minutes for Krasus to push himself up from the floor and even then his head spun. Fragmented thoughts not his own assailed his senses. It was all he could do for a time just to remain conscious.<br><br>Slowly, though, things stabilized enough for him to realize the scope of all that had just happened. Nozdormu, Lord of Time, had been desperately crying out for aid<i>...his</i> aid. He had turned specifically to the lesser dragon, not one of his compatriots.<br><br>But anything that would so distress an Aspect could only be a monumental threat to the rest of Azeroth. Why then choose a lone red dragon and not Alexstrasza or Ysera?<br><br>He tried once more to reach the great dragon, but his efforts only made his head swim again. Steadying himself, Krasus tried to decide what to do instead. One image in particular constantly demanded his attention, the image of a snow-swept mountain area in Kalimdor. Whatever Nozdormu had sought to explain to him had to do with that desolate region.<br><br>Krasus would have to investigate it, but he would need capable assistance, someone who could adapt readily. While Krasus prided himself on his own ability to adapt well, his species was, for the most part, obstinate and set in its ways. He needed someone who would listen, but who could also react instantly as unfolding events required. No, for such unpredictable effort, only one creature would serve. A human.<br><br>In particular, a human named Rhonin.<br><br>A wizard...<br><br>And in Kalimdor, on the steppes of the wild country, a grizzled, aged orc leaned close over a smoky fire. Mumbling words whose origins lay on another, long-lost world, the moss-green figure tossed some leaves upon the fire, increasing the already thick smoke. Fumes filled his humble wood and earth hut.<br><br>The bald, elderly orc leaned over and inhaled. His weary brown eyes were veined and his skin hung in sacks. His teeth were yellow, chipped, and one of his tusks had been broken off years before. He could scarcely rise without aid and when he walked, he did so stooped and slow.<br><br>Yet, even the hardiest warrior paid him fealty as shaman.<br><br>A bit of bone dust, a touch of tannar berries...all part of a tried and true tradition resurrected among the orcs. Kalthar's father had taught him all even during the dark years of the Horde, just as Kalthar's grandsire had taught his father before that.<br><br>And now, for the first time, the withered shaman found himself hoping he had been taught well.<br><br>Voices murmured in his head, the spirits of the world that the orcs now called home. Normally, they whispered little things, life things, but now they murmured anxiously, warning...warning...<br><br>But of what? He had to know more.<br><br>Kalthar reached into a pouch at his waist, removing three dried, black leaves. They were almost all of wha...</p><h2>The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe</h2><p>Reveals that the human body is surrounded by a field of electromagnetic energy that profoundly influences physical and mental health, identifying a link between humanity and the cosmos while investigating areas of alternative medicine.</p><p><p>Lynne McTaggart is an American award-winning investigative journalist whose books include <i>The Baby Brokers: The Marketing of White Babies in America</i> and <i>Kathleen Kennedy: Her Life and Times</i>.

After investigating what only children are really like and whether stopping at one child is an answer to reconciling motherhood and modernity, she learned a lot about herself&#x2014;and a lot about our culture&#x2019;s assumptions. She brings a passion and a laser-sharp intelligence to the subject that cuts through the anxiety, doubt, misinformation, and judgment about what it means to be an only child and what it means to have one. In this heartfelt work, Sandler legitimizes a conversation about the larger societal costs of having more than one. If parents no longer felt they had to have second children to keep from royally screwing up their first, would the majority of them still do it? And if the literature tells us that a child isn&#x2019;t better off with a sibling than without one, and it&#x2019;s not something parents truly want for themselves, then whom is this choice serving? One and Only examines these questions, exploring what the rise of the single-child family means for our economies, our environment, and our freedom. Through this journey, Sandler has quite possibly cracked the code of happiness, demonstrating that having just one may be the way to resolve our countless struggles with adulthood in the modern age.</p><p>Lauren Sandler<b> </b>has written on cultural politics, religion, and inequality for <i>Time, The Atlantic, Slate, </i>and<i> The New York Times. </i>She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b></b>One and Only INTRODUCTION<p></p> IT&#x2019;S NOT WHAT YOU THINK<p></p> <br>This is not a memoir, but to conform to what&#x2019;s expected of an only child, let me start with myself.<br> <br>My mother was deeply devoted to raising me. To have a happy kid, she figured she needed to be a happy mother, and to be a happy mother, she needed to be a happy person. To do that, she had to preserve her authentic self, which she could not imagine doing with a second child.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was all about me,&#x201d; she freely admits to me one night, in a way that simultaneously makes my chest swell with pride (feminism!) and my shoulders contract with a cringe (selfishness!). My parents are in Brooklyn for a weekend visit. It&#x2019;s getting close to midnight, and my mother and I are in our nightgowns, tucked under the covers of the sleep couch. My husband, Justin, and my dad are nursing their beers, feet propped up on the foot of the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;When you were three,&#x201d; she goes on, &#x201c;I thought I was pregnant. I stayed up all night making a pros and cons list. By morning, it was clear to me I couldn&#x2019;t have another kid.&#x201d; She easily recites the &#x201c;con&#x201d; litany: she could continue her career uninterrupted, stay in the apartment she loved instead of trading urbanity for a suburban existence, maintain a certain level of independence, and worry less about money.<br> <br>I interrupt her to ask about the &#x201c;pro&#x201d; list. I have no idea what she&#x2019;s going to say. She&#x2019;s never so much as suggested that there would be a competing list. Instead of replying, she continues, &#x201c;I just would have had to be a totally different person with another kid. My life would have utterly changed. Luckily, it turned out I wasn&#x2019;t pregnant.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get that, Mom. I do. But what about the other list?&#x201d; She&#x2019;s silent. My father studies the label on his beer bottle. &#x201c;Dad, what did you want?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>My father looks up at me. &#x201c;I so loved parenting; I always wanted the experience to be varied, to go on,&#x201d; he says quietly. A vocal strain belies his next words: &#x201c;But you know me. I&#x2019;m not a regretful person.&#x201d; He looks back down at his bottle. &#x201c;What can I say,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;The years passed. It became the choice. Here we are.&#x201d; He grins at me. &#x201c;Where we are isn&#x2019;t half bad, I might add. It just took me some time to get used to the idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>It takes us all some time to get used to the idea. As only children, we have to get used to lacking something that the majority of people have for better or for worse. As parents who choose to stop at one, we have to get used to the nagging feeling that we are choosing for our own children something they can never undo. We&#x2019;re deciding not to know two kids splashing in the bubble bath, playing in the pile of raked leaves, whispering under the cover of darkness, teasing each other at the dinner table, holding hands at our funerals.<br> <br>Everyone seems to think they know who we are, both singletons and parents of singletons. We are the selfish ones. I must be doubly so, as an only child myself, and the mother of one. Who else but an only child would have the sense of self-importance to write about being one, much less suggest that other people consider it for themselves? But after investigating the whole matter, let me offer this spoiler: I don&#x2019;t buy it.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Lonely. Selfish. Maladjusted. These are the words that Toni Falbo, the leading researcher in the small field of only child studies, uses to explain our image of only children. Falbo lists these characteristics so often, they tend to run together as a single word: lonelyselfishmaladjusted.<br> <br>Why did this idea take hold? The academic basis of the miserable singleton specimen was the work of one man, who famously lectured, &#x201c;Being an only child is a disease in itself.&#x201d; Granville Stanley Hall was a leader of the late-nineteenth-century child-study movement and had a national network of study groups called Hall Clubs that spread his teachings. Not a bad way to disseminate his 1896 study, &#x201c;Of Peculiar and Exceptional Children,&#x201d; which described only children as permanent misfits. Never mind that Hall also openly fetishized his own agrarian, big-brood upbringing and disdained the smaller-family urbanity that was creeping into a rapidly industrializing country. Just consider that Hall&#x2014;and every other fledgling psychologist&#x2014;knew close to nothing about credible research practices.<br> <br>Yet for decades, academics and advice columnists alike spread his conclusion that an only child could not develop the same capacity for adjustment as children with siblings. &#x201c;Over-privileged, asocial, royally autonomous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. self-centered, aloof and overly intellectual,&#x201d; is the culturally perceived &#x201c;unchallengeable given&#x201d; of the only child, as sociologist Judith Blake wrote in her 1989 book Family Size and Achievement, which attempted to scientifically dismantle aspects of the stereotype. Later generations of scholars tried to correct the record, but their findings never filtered into popular parenting discourse. The &#x201c;peculiar&#x201d; only child had permeated pop culture, from oddball sidekicks in eighties sitcoms to demon children in horror films. Hellion only children are legendary on screen: The Shining, The Exorcist, Friday the Thirteenth, and The Butcher Boy are all films that rely on a seriously psychotic singleton (yes, even Psycho) to terrorize their innocent costars.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not just fright-fests that traffic in typecasting only children. Name a genre, and there&#x2019;s a list of characters to give the stereotype narrative heft and form: Tom Ripley, Veruca Salt, Eric Cartman. Even superheroes fit the stereotype, misfit loners incapable of truly connecting with citizens of the real world, suspicious in their overintelligence, often fighting against their privilege. Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Iron Man&#x2014;only children all. But this troubled image projected onto the popular consciousness can be complicated by the real-life heroism of some singletons whose ability to connect with others was central to their own superpowers: you might not know it, but Mahatma Gandhi was an only child too.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Around the time my mother stayed awake on the couch with her pros and cons list, she met with the administrators of my nursery school to convince them to extend hours until six o&#x2019;clock in the evening, to accommodate the needs of working parents. The next morning a squadron of mothers cornered her at the door to the school. Wearing pajamas under their trench coats, they allowed her to drop me off before moving in for the attack. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been waiting for you,&#x201d; they said. They were fundamentally opposed to her suggestion of an extended day. &#x201c;We wanted to tell you our children are our only priority.&#x201d;<br> <br>During an interview with British psychologist Bernice Sorensen, who wrote a book called The Only-Child Experience &amp; Adulthood, I mention that my mother chose to stop at one and I am considering the same for my family. Her response is to snap, &#x201c;So, your mother is a narcissist, and you&#x2019;re one too if you make that choice, and you will probably ensure the same future for your daughter. Isn&#x2019;t that what you&#x2019;re telling me?&#x201d; Let&#x2019;s just say she&#x2019;s one singleton who didn&#x2019;t enjoy the experience.<br> <br>The majority of parents say they have second children for the sake of their first child, or at least that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;ve told Gallup pollsters for decades. But it&#x2019;s hard to imagine anything that can be reduced to a simple survey question, much less an issue that layers notions of family, happiness, responsibility, legacy&#x2014;life and death itself, when you think about it. Still, we all know that there&#x2019;s truth in this response: first children tend to be a choice parents make to fulfill their own lives and a second child tends to be a choice parents make to fulfill the life of their existing child.<br> <br>Some people believe that a family with one child isn&#x2019;t really a family, although I defy anyone to strictly define familial normalcy today. Kids are increasingly&#x2014;and happily&#x2014;raised by same-sex parents (in fact, recent studies suggest that lesbian mothers are the best parents of all). Divorce is as common as not. In vitro fertilization has pushed the possible age of conception into the midforties. Siblings are almost as likely stepbrothers and stepsisters as they are the children of their own biological parents.<br> <br>Such developments in the way we define a family produce questions about how to define an only child. Statisticians tend to use the rule that if you spent your first seven years raised as the sole child in a household, you count as one. But I&#x2019;ve met plenty of people who consider themselves onlies because they felt estranged from stepsiblings, and others who would never think of themselves as singletons, despite an age gap of a dozen-odd years, because of how close they are to a brother or sister. These definitions are murky at best. Some only-child experiences and tendencies will apply to some situations (e.g., the seven-year rule works well when understanding selfishness or achievement), and not to others (e.g., even if your sister was in college when you were born, confronting the death of a parent would be radically different without her). It&#x2019;s erroneous to think there is such a thing as &#x201c;normal&#x201d;&#x2014;much less that we should aspire to such a concept.<br> <br>And still, one of America&#x2019;s most successful exports has been the cultural assertion that joyful families are big families: from Meet Me in St. Louis to the Cheaper by the Dozen remakes, the Partridges to the Duggars. One young woman in China, who was raised in a rural village populated by a generation of only children, tells me she never knew what a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; family looked like until the Chinese television authority permitted reruns of Growing Pains when she was in middle school. &#x201c;The Seaver family was the first &#x2018;real family&#x2019; I had ever seen,&#x201d; she says, admitting a crush on Kirk Cameron and excitedly telling me that the actor who played Ben Seaver married a gal from Shanghai. &#x201c;They seemed so happy together&#x2014;why wouldn&#x2019;t I want that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody wants that&#x2014;that&#x2019;s not what people imagine for their lives,&#x201d; says sociologist Philip Morgan at the Carolina Population Center when I ask him to discuss the rising number of only children. In surveys that ask young women how many children they&#x2019;d like to have, ultimately and ideally, no one says they&#x2019;d choose to stop at one child, he tells me. To me, that&#x2019;s like asking a tween girl what her perfect wedding looks like. My childhood fantasy was to get married on an island in Boston&#x2019;s Public Garden in a dress my grandmother would take me shopping for in Paris, with a swing band and guests encircling me and my groom in floating Swan Boats. Instead, my grandmother was confined to a nursing ward, I wore a two-hundred-dollar off-the-rack dress, we got hitched at my parents&#x2019; house and danced to a six-hour mix we made that blew out my dad&#x2019;s speakers. My grandmother&#x2019;s absence aside, it was grand. We envision one thing; we live with another. Our ideals change in concert with our emerging realities&#x2014;even more so if, as we develop, we opt to interrogate what we thought we wanted, and why we thought we wanted it.<br> <br>Here are some things I want: I want to do meaningful work. I want to travel. I want to eat in restaurants and drink in bars. I want to go to movies and concerts. I want to read novels. I want to marinate in solitude. I want to have friendships that regularly sustain and exhilarate me. I want a romantic relationship that involves daily communication beyond interrogatives and imperatives&#x2014;I want to be known. And I want to snuggle with my daughter for as long as she&#x2019;ll let me, being as present in her life as I can while giving her all the space she needs to discover life on her own terms. I want full participation: in the world, in my family, in my friendships, and in my own actualization.<br> <br>In other words, to have a happy kid, I figure I need to be a happy mother, and to be a happy mother, I need to be a happy person. Like my mother, I feel that I need to make choices within the limits of reality&#x2014;which means considering work, finances, pleasure&#x2014;and at the moment I can&#x2019;t imagine how I could possibly do that with another kid. Someone once asked Alice Walker if women (well, woman artists) should have children. She replied, &#x201c;They should have children&#x2014;assuming this is of interest to them&#x2014;but only one.&#x201d; Why? &#x201c;Because with one you can move,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;With more than one, you&#x2019;re a sitting duck.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still, I agonize every time I see my daughter doting on a friend&#x2019;s baby, just as my own heart has a tendency to devour itself whole when I take a new tiny person in my arms, inhaling its sweetness, nuzzling that soft neck, thrilling to every smile and coo. When my daughter was born, after all my anxiety about how I&#x2019;d never changed a diaper, all my avowing that I prefer living things who can verbally communicate, all my certainty that bonding would be an infinite process, and all my fear that I would never again live life on my own terms&#x2014;well, I held my girl, just moments old, and I simply knew what to do. My confidence and capability stunned me. Justin&#x2019;s too&#x2014;though I always knew he was up to the task. And yet when I try to imagine doing it again, I feel even greater doubt than I did the first time.<br> <br>There are plenty of parents who deeply want more than one child and are willing to make profound compromises to have the family they want. These are not people beset with ambivalence or fear that they will forever damage their first child by not offering it the gift of a sibling. These are parents who know what they&#x2019;re in for and know what sacrifices they&#x2019;re willing to make for it. The last thing we need is another person telling women what they should or should not do with their fallopian tubes, their finances, and their futures. I&#x2019;m not here to preach the Gospel of the Only Child.<br> <br>What I&#x2019;m saying is this: when we obsess about which stroller to buy, or whether to go with cloth or paper diapers, or whether organic produce is a must, or whether Mozart or Mingus will make our babies brilliant, or if we&#x2019;ve overscheduled or underscheduled or overfed or underfed or overvaccinated or undervaccinated our kids, yet we fail to consider whether we should actually be having another child, it&#x2019;s time to change the conversation.<br> <br>We ask when people are having kids&#x2014;never a kid, never one child at a time, which is how it usually happens. If a kid has no siblings, it&#x2019;s assumed that there&#x2019;s a hush-hush reason for it: that parents don&#x2019;t like parenthood (because they are selfish), or they care about their status&#x2014;work, money, materialism&#x2014;more than their kid (because they are selfish), or they waited too long (because they are selfish).<br> <br>Over the past century, adulthood has come to promise more than just duty, but pleasure. We search for a partner who will satisfy our desires, develop a career that reflects our strengths, build a life that suits not just our needs, but our wants. Despite the fact that it&#x2019;s no longer possible to have a middle-class life on one income&#x2014;and often not even on two&#x2014;we envision a liberated existence, one of satisfaction and fulfillment, a life built upon intentionality and individualism rather than obligation and role filling. This liberated adulthood exists at odds with parenting.<br> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t take forced population control to raise the number of a country&#x2019;s only children&#x2014;the relative incompatibility of motherhood and modernity has taken care of that. Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Japan, and Korea all have fertility rates of less than 1.4 per woman, about half the number of kids women in those countries were having in the seventies. While family policy that helps to manage the collision between work and parenthood&#x2014;and particularly motherhood&#x2014;is nearly nonexistent in the United...</p><h2>Pasta, Pane, Vino: Deep Travels Through Italy&#39;s Food Culture</h2><p>Following the acclaimed Rice, Noodle, Fish and Grape, Olive, Pig, comes Pasta, Pane, Vino: a beautifully photographed food-lover's travelogue through Italy, from the James Beard Award-winning author Matt Goulding and his popular website Roads &amp; Kingdoms.

We&#x2019;d reached a plateau, and she was satisfied with the progress she&#x2019;d made. I wasn&#x2019;t. The physical therapist at University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia had warned me that this might happen. It wasn&#x2019;t that my daughter was weak or lazy; it was far worse than that&#x2014;she was bored.</p><p>&#x201c;Two more?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you. . . .&#x201d; She plucked at her shorts and avoided my eyes. &#x201c;Your voice; it carries.&#x201d;</p><p>I placed an elbow on my knee, chin on fist, sat farther back on the sit-up bench, and glanced around. We weren&#x2019;t alone. There was a kid in a Durant Quarterback Club T-shirt who was trying to bulk up his 145-pound frame at one of the Universal machines. I&#x2019;m not sure why he was up here&#x2014;there were no televisions, and it wasn&#x2019;t as fancy as the main gym downstairs. I understood all the machines up here&#x2014;you didn&#x2019;t have to plug any of them in&#x2014;but I wondered about him; it could be that he was here because of Cady.</p><p>&#x201c;Two more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Piss off.&#x201d;</p><p>The kid snickered, and I looked at him. I glanced back at my daughter. This was good; anger sometimes got her to finish up, even if it cost me the luxury of conversation for the rest of the evening. It didn&#x2019;t matter tonight; she had a dinner date and then had to be home for an important phone call. I had zip. I had all the time in the world.</p><p>She had cut her auburn hair short to match the spot where they had made the U-shaped incision that had allowed her swelling brain to survive. Only a small scar was visible at the hairline. She was beautiful, and the pain in the ass was that she knew it.</p><p>It got her pretty much whatever she wanted. Beauty was life&#x2019;s E-ZPass. I was lucky I got to ride on the shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Two more?&#x201d;</p><p>She picked up her water bottle and squeezed out a gulp, leveling the cool eyes back on me. We sat there looking at each other, both of us dressed in gray. She stretched a finger out and pulled the band of my T-shirt down, grazing a fingernail on my exposed collarbone. &#x201c;That one?&#x201d;</p><p>Just because she was beautiful didn&#x2019;t mean she wasn&#x2019;t smart. Diversion was another of her tactics. I had enough scars to divert the entire First Division. She had known this scar and had seen it on numerous occasions. Her question was a symptom of the memory loss that Dr. Rissman had mentioned.</p><p>She continued to poke my shoulder with the finger. &#x201c;That one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That one?&#x201d;</p><p>Cady never gave up.</p><p>It was a family trait, and in our tiny family, stories were the coinage of choice, a bartering in the aesthetic of information and the athletics of emotion, so I answered her. &#x201c;Tet.&#x201d;</p><p>She set her water bottle down on the rubber-padded floor. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Before you were born.&#x201d;</p><p>She lowered her head and looked at me through her lashes, one cheek pulled up in a half smile. &#x201c;Things happened before I was born?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, nothing really important.&#x201d;</p><p>She took a deep breath, gripped the sides of the bench, and put all her effort into straightening the lever action of thirty pounds at her legs. Slowly, the weights lifted to the limit of the movement and then, just as slowly, dropped back. After a moment, she caught her breath. &#x201c;Marine inspector, right?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why Marines?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was Vietnam, and I was gonna be drafted, so it was a choice.&#x201d; I was consistently amazed at what her damaged brain chose to remember.</p><p>&#x201c;What was Vietnam like?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Confusing, but I got to meet Martha Raye.&#x201d;</p><p>Unsatisfied with my response, she continued to study my scar. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have any tattoos.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I sighed, just to let her know that her tactics weren&#x2019;t working.</p><p>&#x201c;I have a tattoo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have two.&#x201d; I cleared my throat in an attempt to end the conversation. She pulled up the cap sleeve of her Philadelphia City Sports T-shirt, exposing the faded, Cheyenne turtle totem on her shoulder. She was probably unaware that she&#x2019;d been having treatments to have it removed; it had been the exboyfriend&#x2019;s idea, all before the accident. &#x201c;The other one&#x2019;s on your butt, but we don&#x2019;t have to look for it now.&#x201d;</p><p>The kid snickered again. I turned and stared at him with a little more emphasis this time.</p><p>&#x201c;Bear was in Vietnam with you, right?&#x201d;</p><p>She was smiling as I turned back to her. All the women in my life smiled when they talked about Henry Standing Bear. It was a bit annoying, but Henry was my best and lifelong friend, so I got over it. He owned the Red Pony, a bar on the edge of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, only a mile from my cabin, and he was the one who was taking Cady to dinner. I wasn&#x2019;t invited. He and my daughter were in cahoots. They had pretty much been in cahoots since she had been born.</p><p>&#x201c;Henry was in-country, Special Operations Group; we didn&#x2019;t serve together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was he like back then?&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about it. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s mellowed, a little.&#x201d; It was a frightening thought. &#x201c;Two more?&#x201d;</p><p>Her gray eyes flashed. &#x201c;One more.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled. &#x201c;One more.&#x201d;</p><p>Cady&#x2019;s slender hands returned to the sides of the bench, and I watched as the toned legs once again levitated and lowered the thirty pounds. I waited a moment, then lumbered up and placed a kiss at the horseshoe-shaped scar and helped her stand. The physical progress was moving ahead swimmingly, mostly due to the advantages of her stellar conditioning and youth, but the afternoon workouts took their toll, and she was usually a little unsteady by the time we finished.</p><p>I held her hand and picked up her water and tried not to concentrate on the fact that my daughter had been a fast-track, hotshot lawyer back in Philly only two months earlier and that now she was here in Wyoming and was trying to remember that she had tattoos and how to walk without assistance.</p><p>We made our way toward the stairwell and the downstairs showers. As we passed the kid at the machine, he looked at Cady admiringly and then at me. &#x201c;Hey, Sheriff ?&#x201d;</p><p>I paused for a moment and steadied Cady on my arm. &#x201c;Yep?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;J.P. said you once bench-pressed six plates.&#x201d;</p><p>I continued looking down at him. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>He gestured toward the steel plates on the rack at the wall. &#x201c;Jerry Pilch? The football coach? He said senior year, before you went to USC, you bench-pressed six plates.&#x201d; He continued to stare at me. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s over three hundred pounds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, well.&#x201d; I winked. &#x201c;Jerry&#x2019;s always had a tendency to exaggerate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought so.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded to the kid and helped Cady down the steps. It&#x2019;d been eight plates, actually, but that had been a long time ago.</p><p>My shower was less complicated than Cady&#x2019;s, so I usually got out before her and waited on the bench beside the Clear Creek bridge. I placed my summer-wear palm-leaf hat on my head, slipped on my ten-year-old Ray-Bans, and shrugged the workout bag&#x2019;s strap farther onto my shoulder so that it didn&#x2019;t press my Absaroka County sheriff&#x2019;s star into my chest. I pushed open the glass door and stepped into the perfect fading glory of a high-plains summer afternoon. It was vacation season, creeping up on rodeo weekend, and the streets were full of people from somewhere else.</p><p>I took a left and started toward the bridge and the bench. I sat next to the large man with the ponytail and placed the gym bag between us. &#x201c;How come I wasn&#x2019;t invited to dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>The Cheyenne Nation kept his head tilted back, eyes closed, taking in the last warmth of the afternoon sun. &#x201c;We have discussed this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Saturday night, and I don&#x2019;t have anything to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You will find something.&#x201d; He took a deep breath, the only sign that he wasn&#x2019;t made of wood and selling cigars. &#x201c;Where is Vic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Firearms recertification in Douglas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about my scary undersheriff from Philadelphia; how she could outshoot, outdrink, and outswear every cop I knew, and how she was now representing the county at the Wyoming Law Enforcement Academy. I was unsure if that was a positive thing. &#x201c;Yep, not a safe weekend to be in Douglas.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded, almost imperceptibly. &#x201c;How is all that going?&#x201d;</p><p>I took a moment to discern what &#x201c;all that&#x201d; might mean. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really sure.&#x201d; He raised an eyelid and studied me in a myopic fashion. &#x201c;We seem to be having a problem getting in sync.&#x201d; The eyelid closed, and we sat there as a silence passed. &#x201c;Where are you going to dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not going to tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon.&#x201d;</p><p>His face remained impassive. &#x201c;We have discussed this.&#x201d;</p><p>We had&#x2014;it was true. The Bear had expressed the opinion that for both of our mental healths, it might be best if Cady and I didn&#x2019;t spend every waking hour in each other&#x2019;s company. It was difficult, but I was going to have to let her out of my sight sometime. &#x201c;In town or over in Sheridan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not going to tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>I was disconcerted by the flash of a camera and turned to see a woman from somewhere else smile and continue down the sidewalk toward the Busy Bee Caf�, where I would likely be having my dinner, alone. I turned to look at Henry Standing Bear&#x2019;s striking profile. &#x201c;You should sit with me more often; I&#x2019;m photogenic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were taking photographs with a greater frequency before you arrived.&#x201d;</p><p>I ignored him. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s allergic to plums.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure if she&#x2019;ll remember that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No alcohol.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about that advisory and came clean. &#x201c;I let her have a glass of red wine last weekend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned and looked at him. &#x201c;She told you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Cahoots. I had a jealous inkling that the Bear was making more progress in drawing all of Cady back to us than I was.</p><p>I stretched my legs and crossed my boots; they were still badly in need of a little attention. I adjusted my gun belt so that the hammer of my .45 wasn&#x2019;t digging into my side. &#x201c;We still on for the Rotary thing on Friday?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Rotary was sponsoring a debate between me and prosecuting attorney Kyle Straub; we were the two candidates for the position of Absaroka County sheriff. After five elections and twenty-four sworn years, I usually did pretty well at debates but felt a little hometown support might be handy, so I had asked Henry to come. &#x201c;Think of it as a public service&#x2014;most Rotarians have never even met a Native American.&#x201d;</p><p>That finally got the one eye to open again, and he turned toward me. &#x201c;Would you like me to wear a feather?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll just introduce you as an Injun.&#x201d;</p><p>Cady placed her hand on my shoulder and leaned over to allow the Cheyenne Nation to bestow a kiss on her cheek. She was wearing blue jeans and a tank top with, I was pleased to see, the fringed, concho-studded leather jacket I&#x2019;d bought for her years ago. It could still turn brisk on July nights along the foothills of the Bighorn Mountains.</p><p>She jostled the hat on my head and dropped her gym bag on top of mine. She turned to Henry. &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;</p><p>He opened his other eye. &#x201c;Ready.&#x201d;</p><p>He rose effortlessly, and I thought if I got it in quick that maybe I&#x2019;d get an answer. &#x201c;Where you going?&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled as the Bear came around the back of the bench and took her elbow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not allowed to tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>Cady&#x2019;s current love interest, Vic&#x2019;s younger brother, was supposed to be flying in from Philadelphia on Tuesday for a Wild West vacation. I still hadn&#x2019;t gotten a straight answer as to with whom he was staying. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget that Michael is calling.&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head as they walked past me, pausing to lift my hat and plant a kiss on the crown of my head. &#x201c;I know when he&#x2019;s calling, Daddy. I&#x2019;ll be home long before then.&#x201d; She shoved my hat down, hard.</p><p>I readjusted and watched as they crossed the sidewalk, where Henry helped her into Lola, his powder-blue &#x2019;59 T-Bird convertible. The damage I&#x2019;d done to the classic automobile was completely invisible due to the craftsmanship of the body men in South Philly, and I watched as the Wyoming sun glistened on the Thunderbird&#x2019;s flanks. I had a moment of hope that they wouldn&#x2019;t get going when the starter continued to grind, but the aged Y-Block caught and blew a slight fantail of carbon into the street. He slipped her into gear, and they were gone.</p><p>As usual, I got the gym bags, and he got the girl.</p><p>I considered my options. There was the plastic-wrapped burrito at the Kum-and-Go, the stuffed peppers at the Durant Home for Assisted Living, a potpie from the kitchenette back at the jail, or the Busy Bee Caf�. I gathered up my collection of bags and hustled across the bridge over Clear Creek before Dorothy Caldwell changed her mind and turned the sign, written in cursive, hanging on her door.</p><p>&#x201c;Not the usual?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>She poured my iced tea and looked at me, fist on hip. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t like it last time?&#x201d;</p><p>I struggled to remember but gave up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember what it was last time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is Cady&#x2019;s condition contagious?&#x201d;</p><p>I ignored the comment and tried to decide what to order. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m feeling experimental. Are you still offering your Weekend Cuisines of the World?&#x201d; It was an attempt on her part to broaden the culinary experience of our little corner of the high plains.</p><p>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where, in the world, are we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vietnam.&#x201d;</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t take me long to respond. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pass.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really good.&#x201d;</p><p>I weaved my fingers and rested my elbows on the counter. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chicken with lemongrass.&#x201d; She continued to look at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Henry&#x2019;s dish?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where I got the recipe.&#x201d;</p><p>I withered under her continued gaze. &#x201c;All right.&#x201d;</p><p>She busied herself in the preparation of the entree, and I sipped my tea. I glanced around at the five other people in the homey caf� but didn&#x2019;t recognize anyone. I must have been thirsty from watching Cady work out, because a third of the glass was gone in two gulps. I set it back on the Formica, and Dorothy refilled it immediately. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t talk about it much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The war.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded as she put the tan plastic pitcher on the counter next to me. I turned my glass in the circular imprint of its condensation. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny, but it came up earlier this afternoon.&#x201d; I met her eyes under the silver hair. &#x201c;Cady asked about the scar on my collarbone, the one from Tet.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded slightly. &#x201c;Surely she&#x2019;s seen that before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>Dorothy took a deep breath. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, she&#x2019;s doing better every day.&#x201d; She reached out and squeezed my shoulder just at said scar. &#x201c;But, be careful. . . .&#x201d; She looked concerned.</p><p>I looked up at her. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Visitations like those tend to come in threes.&#x201d;</p><p>I watched as she took the tea and refilled some of the other customers.

From his collection he created The Pipe Book, which was first printed in 1924 and has rarely been out of print since. The book is a thorough exploration of every type of pipe-primitive mounds and earthen pipes; more elegant models of ivory, clay, and porcelain; and of course modern briers, cobs, and meerschaums-with in-depth explanations of their uses, structures, and origins, as well as fascinating anthropological discussions on smoking in various cultures.</p><p>In 1907, in London, Alfred Dunhill, a young man in his early 30s, opened his first tobacconist's shop.

Navigating the broad &#39;river of anarchy&#39;, from Taoism to Situationism, from Ranters to Punk rockers, from individualists to communists, from anarcho-syndicalists to anarcha-feminists, &#39;Demanding the Impossible&#39; is an authoritative and lively study of a widely misunderstood subject. It explores the key anarchist concepts of society and the state, freedom and equality, authority and power and investigates the successes and failure of the anarchist movements throughout the world. While remaining sympathetic to anarchism, it presents a balanced and critical account. It covers not only the classic anarchist thinkers, such as Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Reclus and Emma Goldman, but also other libertarian figures, such as Nietzsche, Camus, Gandhi, Foucault and Chomsky. No other book on anarchism covers so much so incisively. In this updated edition, a new epilogue examines the most recent developments, including &#39;post-anarchism&#39; and &#39;anarcho-primitivism&#39; as well as the anarchist contribution to the peace, green and &#39;Global Justice&#39; movements. Demanding the Impossible is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand what anarchists stand for and what they have achieved. It will also appeal to those who want to discover how anarchism offers an inspiring and original body of ideas and practices which is more relevant than ever in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Peter Marshall is a historian, philosopher, biographer and travel writer. He has written fifteen books, has taught at several British universities and occasionally works in broadcasting. He lives in Devon.The goal of an egalitarian, communal society has always united Marxists and leftist socialists, some of the latter (often if not always described as anarchists) refusing any truck with centralized power At various times, such ideas have found relatively wide appeal, and this era is one&#x2014;expressed for instance in the antiglobalization movement's emphases on local control and direct democracy&#x2014;making Marshall's comprehensive treatment a timely read. Newly revised and updated, this indispensable history of social libertarian thought now reaches into the 21st century&#x2014;touching upon themes echoed in other recent titles, including Raj Patel's <i>The Value of Nothing</i>. Marshall casts a wide net, gathering all traces of antiauthoritarian socialist thought in works from Lao Tzu through Noam Chomsky, social ecology, and the Zapatistas. Readers will be repeatedly rewarded by Marshall's judiciousness and close readings of both the great names in anarchist history&#x2014;Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Tolstoy&#x2014;and less expected contributors&#x2014;Rousseau, Swift, and Burke. Blowing away cobwebs of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, this is a stimulating portrait of a highly varied but distinctive political ideal, tradition, and practice arising from the enduring human impulse to be free. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book is in very good condition, some slight edge-wear to dust jacket. This novel was made into a movie for television.</p><p><b>Shirley Conran</b> has worked as a design consultant, journalist, and editor for <i>The Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Observer.</i> Her first book, <i>Superwoman,</i> sold more than a million copies worldwide and was followed by eleven bestsellers. She currently lives in London.<b>1</b> <p> It was a warm October evening in 1978 with the distant skyscrapers sparkling in the dusk as Maxine glanced through the limousine window at the familiar New York skyline. She had chosen this route for that view. Now, in the discreet, hushed comfort of the Lincoln Continental, they stood stuck in traffic on the Triboro Bridge. Never mind, she told herself, there was plenty of time before the meeting. And the view was worth it -- like diamonds sprinkled across the sky. </p><p> Her neatly folded sable coat lay beside the maroon crocodile jewel case. The nine maroon-leather suitcases -- all stamped in gold with a tiny coronet and the initials M de C -- were stacked beside the chauffeur or stowed in the trunk. Maxine traveled with very little fuss and at enormous expense, usually someone else's. She took absolutely no notice of luggage allowances; she would say, with a shrug of the shoulders, that she liked comfort; so one suitcase contained her pink silk sheets, her special down-filled pillow, and the baby's shawl, delicate as a cream lace cobweb, that she used instead of a bed jacket. </p><p> Although most of the suitcases held clothes (beautifully packed between crisp sheets of tissue paper), one case was fitted as a small maroon-leather office; another carried a large medicine box packed with pills, creams, douches, ampoules, disposable syringes for her vitamin injections and the various suppositories that are considered normal treatment in France but frowned on by Anglo-Saxons. Maxine had once tried to buy syringes in Detroit -- <i>mon Dieu,</i> could they not tell the difference between a drug addict and a French countess? One had to look after one's body, it was the only one you were going to get and you had to be careful what you put on it and in it. Maxine saw no reason to force terrible food on the stomach merely because it was suspended thirty-five thousand feet above sea level; all the other first-class passengers from Paris had munched their way through six overcooked courses, but Maxine had merely accepted a little caviar (no toast) and only one glass of champagne (nonvintage, but Mo�t, she observed with approval before accepting it). From a burgundy suede tote bag she had then produced a small white plastic box that contained a small silver spoon, a pot of homemade yogurt and a large, juicy peach from her own hothouse. </p><p> Afterward, while other passengers had read or dozed, Maxine had taken out her miniature tape recorder, her tiny gold pencil, and a large, cheap office duplicate book. The tape recorder was for instructions to her secretary, the office duplicate book was for notes, drafts and memos of telephone conversations; Maxine tore them off and sent them on their way, always retaining a copy of what she had written; then when she returned to France, her secretary filed the duplicates. Maxine was well organized in an unobtrusive way; she didn't believe in being too well organized and she couldn't stand bustle or hustle, but she could only operate when things were orderly; she liked order even more than she liked comfort. </p><p> When Madame la Comtesse booked a reservation for a business trip, the Plaza automatically booked a bilingual secretary for her. She sometimes traveled with her own secretary, but it was not always convenient to have the girl hanging round one's neck like a pair of skates. Also, as the girl had now been with Maxine for almost twenty-five years, she was able to keep an eye on things at home in Maxine's absence; from the condition of her sons and her grapes to the times when Monsieur le Comte returned home and with whom. </p><p> Mademoiselle Janine reported everything with devoted zeal. Since 1956, Mademoiselle Janine had worked hard for the Ch�teau de Chazalle and she shone in the reflected glory of Maxine's success. She had first worked for the de Chazalles twenty-two years ago, when Maxine was twenty-five and had opened the ch�teau as a historical hotel, museum and amusement park, before anybody (except the locals) had heard of de Chazalle champagne. Mademoiselle Janine had fussed around Maxine from the time her three sons were babies, and she would have found life intolerably dull without the family. Indeed, she had been with the de Chazalles for so long that she almost <i>felt</i> like one of the family. But not quite. They were -- and always would be -- separated by the invisible, unbreakable barriers of class. </p><p> Like New York, Maxine was glamorous and efficient, which was why she liked the quick pace of the city, liked the way that New Yorkers worked with neat, brisk speed whether they were serving hamburgers, heaving garbage off the sidewalk or squeezing fifty cents' worth of fresh orange juice for you on a sunny street corner. She appreciated these fast-thinking people, their tough humor, their crisp jokes, and privately thought that New Yorkers had all the <i>joie de vivre</i> of the French, without being nearly so rude. She also felt at home with New York women. She enjoyed observing, as if they were another species, those cool, polite, impeccable women executives as they operated under the merciless pressure of the grab for power, the lunge for money, the lusting after someone else's job. Like theirs, Maxine's self-discipline was colossal, but -- at the age of forty-seven -- her grasp of people-politics was even better. Had it not been so, she would not have been traveling to meet Lili. </p><p> That gold-digging slut! </p><p> But Maxine was undoubtedly intrigued by Lili's offer and it was partly her curiosity that had brought her all the way across the Atlantic. Again she wondered whether she would accept the job. She would have thought that Lili -- who must be about twenty-eight years old by now -- would never have wanted to see Maxine again. Maxine remembered that long-ago expression of startled pain in the flashing chestnut eyes of the troublemaker whom the press had nicknamed "Tiger-Lili." </p><p> She had been amazed to receive the telephone call, to hear that low, sensual voice sound so astonishingly humble, as Lili had asked Maxine to meet her in New York to decorate Lili's new duplex on Central Park South. Lili wanted her new home to be a showpiece, a conversation-stopper, and she knew that Maxine could supply the correct blend of erudite elegance and spirited style. The budget would be as large as was necessary, and of course all expenses for Maxine's trip to New York would be paid whether or not she decided to accept the commission. </p><p> There had been a pause, then Lili had added in a penitent voice, "I would also like to feel that something no longer has such painful memories for you. For so many years I have lived unhappily with my conscience, and now I dearly wish to do whatever is necessary to be at peace with you." </p><p> After this apology there had been a thoughtful pause, then the conversation had turned to Maxine's work. "I understand you've just finished Shawborough Castle," Lili had said, "and I also heard about the stunning job you did for Dominique Fresanges -- it must be wonderful to have a talent such as yours, to rescue historic houses from decay, to make so many homes beautiful and comfortable while they still remain a heritage for the world...." </p><p> It had been a long time since Maxine had enjoyed a holiday in New York by herself, so eventually she had agreed to make the journey. Lili had asked Maxine to tell nobody of the meeting until after it had taken place. "You know the press won't leave me alone," she had explained. And it was true. Not since Greta Garbo had there been an international movie star who so intrigued the public. </p><p> As the limousine started to crawl forward, Maxine glanced at her diamond wristwatch -- there was plenty of time before the six-thirty meeting at the Pierre. Maxine was rarely impatient; she disliked being late, but assumed that everyone else would be. That was life today -- undependable. If a situation could be improved, Maxine would generally do it with a slight, one-sided smile, a look that combined conspiratorial charm with a hint of menace. If a situation could not be improved, then she folded her hands in her lap and imperturbably accepted <i>la loi de Murphy.</i> </p><p> She happened to catch sight of herself in the back mirror of the limousine and leaned toward it, lifting her jaw above the cream lace jabot and poking it sideways at her reflection. It was only five weeks since the operation, but the tiny scars in front of her ears had already disappeared. Mr. Wilson had done an excellent job and it had only cost a thousand pounds, including the anesthetist and the London clinic bill. There was no tautness, no pulling at the mouth or eyes; she simply looked healthy, glowing and fifteen years younger -- certainly not forty-seven. It was sensible to have it done when you were still young, so that nobody noticed, or, if they did, they couldn't pin you down; today you never saw an eyebag on an actress over thirty, or on an actor, come to think of it. Nobody had noticed her absence; she had been out of the clinic in four days and had then spent ten days in Tunisia where she had lost seven pounds, a satisfying bonus. She simply could not understand why some people went all the way to Brazil and paid heaven knows what for their lifts. </p><p> Maxine was a firm believer in self-improvement, especially surgical. One <i>owes</i> it to oneself, was her justification; her teeth, eyes, nose, chin, breasts, all had been lifted or braced until Maxine was a mass of almost invisible stitches. Even so, she was no great beauty, but when she thought back to her girlhood and remembered the prominent nose, the horselike teeth and her painful self-consciousness, she was grateful that years ago she had been persistently urged to do something about it. </p><p> It had not been necessary to do anything about her legs.

In L.A. only a few weeks and still living in his car, he answered a want ad for a bass player placed by someone who identified himself only as &#x201c;Slash.&#x201d; Soon after, the most dangerous band in the world was born. Guns N&#x2019; Roses went on to sell more than 100 million albums worldwide. <br><br>In <i>It's So Easy</i>, Duff recounts GN&#x2019;R&#x2019;s unlikely trajectory to a string of multiplatinum albums, sold-out stadium concerts, and global acclaim. But that kind of glory can take its toll, and it did&#x2014;ultimately&#x2014;on Duff, as well as on the band itself. As GN&#x2019;R began to splinter, Duff felt that he himself was done, too. But his near death as a direct result of alcoholism proved to be his watershed, the turning point that led to his unique path to sobriety and the unexpected choices he has made for himself since. In a voice that is as honest as it is indelibly his own, Duff&#x2014;one of rock&#x2019;s smartest and most articulate personalities&#x2014;takes readers on his harrowing journey through the dark heart of one of the most notorious bands in rock-and-roll history and out the other side.</p><p><b>Duff McKagan</b> played bass for Guns N&#x2019; Roses for twelve years and co-wrote many of their most iconic songs. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. Duff formed Velvet Revolver with his former band mate Slash and fronts his own band, Loaded. He writes weekly columns for Seattleweekly.com and ESPN.com. McKagan lives in Seattle with his wife, supermodel Susan Holmes McKagan, and their two daughters.

With this manual in hand you will be able to diagnose and manage hundreds of insect, mite, weed, plant disease, and nematode pests. Inside you&#39;ll find updated information on how to use environmentally safe, ecologically based IPM methods; landscape designs that prevent pests; how to select resistant varieties; advice on the use of less-toxic pesticides such as botanicals, oils, and soaps; and tips on planting, irrigating, and other plant-care cultural activities that help in avoiding problems. Contains over one hundred pages of easy-to-use tree and shrub pest tables; invaluable in helping you identify common pest problems now on over 200 types of ornamental trees and shrubs. Includes 432 color photographs, 117 drawings and tables, references, glossary, and an index.</p><p>Compiled by scientists at the University of California's Statewide Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Project, this guide is aimed at homeowners and gardeners as well as landscape and pest management professionals. There are chapters on insects, mites, snails, and slugs; diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses; weeds; nematodes; and abiotic disorders. Numerous color photographs help identify symptoms and pests. The nearly 50 pages of tree and pest tables make this guide immediately useful; trees and other woody plants are listed alphabetically by their common names along with symptoms and probable causes of disease. This publication is not just for Californians since most of the trees and shrubs discussed are grown throughout the United States. Readers looking for information on a wide range of garden and household pests should turn to works like Michael Hansen's Pest Control for Home and Garden (LJ 3/15/93) or William Olkowski and others' Common-Sense Pest Control (LJ 5/1/91), but Dreistadt offers considerably more detailed information on common woody plant pests. A sound choice for horticulture and pest management collections.<br><i>William H. Wiese, Iowa State Univ. Lib., Ames</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Clear, concise and accessible, this guide to pest management is likely to become a valued resource for homeowners, and should be considered a required text for landscape managers and their crews. Unlike some other books in the field, which survey pests and the poisons that are designed to kill them, entomologists and plant pathologists at UC Berkeley have collaborated with Dreistadt and Clark to produce a complete and sensible approach to controlling pests through choice of plant types; planting practices; early identification of problems; adopting mechanical, physical and biological combatant measures; and, as a last resort, chemical antidotes. The details of pests' life cycles are revealed--and even interesting. Tables in the back of the book help identify plant varieties, symptoms and more. Although the book focuses on trees and shrubs in California landscapes, the information is sound and broad enough to be of help in other climates, too.

Housing more than 160 million books, manuscripts, photographs, recordings, and maps, it&#x2019;s the largest library in the world. If you put its bookshelves together in a single line, they would extend 838 miles.<br> <br>The current collection owes its start to one of America&#x2019;s greatest Founding Fathers. After the Library of Congress was burned to the ground by the British during the War of 1812, Thomas Jefferson, then in retirement at Monticello, offered once more to be of service to his young nation. Jefferson, who owned the nation&#x2019;s largest private collection of books&#x2014;6,500 at the time&#x2014;offered the entire lot to the newly rebuilt library &#x201c;for whatever price found appropriate.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jefferson was a voracious reader and a distinguished intellect. Along with hundreds of books that matched his varied interests was a well-worn two-volume set that he believed offered his nation a warning.<br> <br>Jefferson had bought these volumes, bound in leather and filled with yellowed pages that crackled when you turned them, forty years earlier when he&#x2019;d been a young red-haired law student in Williamsburg. By then he&#x2019;d already developed a reputation as a passionate debater in the service of justice&#x2014;even if it meant challenging the laws of the Crown. In 1765, the young rabble-rouser had become known for his strident opposition to Parliament&#x2019;s passage of the Stamp Act, the latest in a series of unjust taxes imposed by the British on the colonies without representation.<br> <br>As a student of the law, Jefferson was curious about laws of many kinds, including those that had a voice in exotic lands or claimed to carry the word of God. That is why, when he wandered into the offices of the Virginia Gazette, the local newspaper that doubled as a bookstore, one day in October 1765, Jefferson found the two-volume set so tantalizing. Printed in London by a British lawyer named George Sale, the books were one of the first English translations of the Quran. After paying sixteen shillings, Thomas Jefferson held in his hands the holy book of Islam. He kept them among his possessions for the following four decades.<br> <br>When I first heard that one of our nation&#x2019;s Founding Fathers owned one of America&#x2019;s earliest copies of the Quran, I endeavored to do some research on it. I was curious as to why Jefferson, a man famously curious and cosmopolitan, but also skeptical of organized religion, had it in his possession.<br> <br>We don&#x2019;t know exactly how closely Thomas Jefferson read the Quran he owned. We do know that he is the only Founding Father to have a basic understanding of Arabic. We do know that he promoted and championed the creation of an Oriental languages department at his alma mater, the College of William &amp; Mary. And we do know that he would be the first American president to go to war with Islamic radicals.<br> <br>It is clear, however, that Jefferson was, to put it mildly, suspicious of Islam. He compared the faith with Catholicism, and believed that neither had undergone a reformation. Both religions, he felt, suppressed rational thought and persecuted skeptics. When combined with the power of the state, religion would corrupt and stifle individual rights. Islam, to Jefferson&#x2019;s mind, provided a cautionary tale of what happened when a faith insisted on combining religious and political power into one.<br> <br>As a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, Jefferson cited Islam as an example for why Virginia should not have an official religion. A state religion, he argued, would quash &#x201c;free enquiry,&#x201d; as he recorded in his notes at the time. He knew Islam held little tolerance for other faiths.<br> <br>But Jefferson was neither a bigot nor an Islamophobe. The irony of Jefferson&#x2019;s observations about Islam is that they were made in service of an argument that would ensure that Muslims&#x2014;along with Jews, Christians, atheists, and adherents of every other faith&#x2014;would have full citizenship as Virginians, and ultimately, as Americans.<br> <br>The landmark legislation Jefferson championed, &#x201c;A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom,&#x201d; which served as a model for the United States Constitution a decade later, ensured that there was no official religion of state. Between 1776 and 1779, Jefferson drafted more than one hundred pieces of legislation, but he was most proud of number 82, which is referenced on his gravestone as &#x201c;the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom.&#x201d; The fiercely controversial bill disestablished Christianity as the official religion of his state.<br> <br>Jefferson&#x2019;s legislation was nothing short of revolutionary, a first in the history of the world: absolute freedom of religious conscience and permanent separation of church and state. And as evidenced by his copious notes, Jefferson&#x2019;s knowledge of the Quran and Islam had shaped his views of the importance of protecting religious liberty.<br> <br>Jefferson believed that everyone should have the right to worship, or not to worship, as they choose. It was, unfortunately, not a view shared by the Muslims he eventually encountered.<br> <br>In March 1786, after America had won its independence, Jefferson was serving as minister to France, shuttling between European capitals to secure commercial agreements. One of the thorniest challenges he had to confront was the growing power of the Barbary States, four North African territories that sponsored marauding pirates who were increasingly confiscating thousands of dollars in American shipping and enslaving hundreds of U.S. citizens in prisons across the Mediterranean.<br> <br>In London, Jefferson and his fellow diplomat John Adams met with the ambassador from the pasha of Tripoli, a man named Abdul Rahman, to resolve the growing dispute. The war that existed between his nation and America, the ambassador explained, &#x201c;was founded on the Laws of their Prophet.&#x201d; The capture of U.S. ships and people was a just and holy war, sanctioned by the Quran.<br> <br>Jefferson and Adams took meticulous notes of the meeting. &#x201c;It was written in their Koran,&#x201d; the two Americans noted, &#x201c;that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners, and that every Musselman [Muslim] who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jefferson needed only reference his own two-volume translation of the Quran to understand that everything in the ambassador&#x2019;s explanation of the Barbary States&#x2019; &#x201c;holy war&#x201d; against America was accurate and faithful to Islam&#x2019;s holy book.<br> <br>The Quran&#x2019;s Sura (or chapter) 9, verse 29, explains the Islamic duty to make war upon non-Muslims:<br> <br>Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e., Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.*<br> <br>Sura 47, verse 4 sanctions the taking of captives as spoils of war:<br> <br>So, when you meet (in fight Jihad in Allah&#x2019;s Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e., take them as captives). Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e., free them without ransom), or ransom (according to what benefits Islam), until the war lays down its burden. Thus [you are ordered by Allah to continue in carrying out Jihad against the disbelievers till they embrace Islam (i.e., are saved from the punishment in the Hell-fire) or at least come under your protection], but if it had been Allah&#x2019;s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.<br> <br>And Sura 2, verse 154, clearly outlines that Allah will reward holy warriors who fight on his behalf:<br> <br>And say not of those who are killed in the Way of Allah, &#x201c;They are dead.&#x201d; Nay, they are living, but you perceive (it) not.<br> <br>What the ambassador of Tripoli was explaining to the future second and third presidents of the United States was the concept of jihad&#x2014;God&#x2019;s lawful war against nonbelievers. To drive the point home, the ambassador left Jefferson and Adams with a final image of what American sailors would face on the high seas. The two American diplomats recounted what the Barbary ambassador had told them:<br> <br>It was a law that the first who boarded an enemy&#x2019;s vessel should have one slave, more than his share with the rest, which operated as an incentive to the most desperate valour and enterprise, that it was the practice of their corsairs to bear down upon a ship, for each sailor to take a dagger in each hand and another in his mouth, and leap on board, which so terrified their enemies that very few ever stood against them, that he verily believed the Devil assisted his countrymen, for they were almost always successful.<br> <br>Again, the ambassador was hewing closely to Islam&#x2019;s holy text. Prisoners could be killed, sold into slavery, or ransomed. Sura 33, verses 26 and 27:<br> <br>And those of the people of the Scripture who backed them (the disbelievers) Allah brought them down from their forts and cast terror into their hearts, (so that) a group (of them) you killed, and a group (of them) you made captives. And He caused you to inherit their lands, and their houses, and their riches, and a land which you had not trodden (before). And Allah is Able to do all things.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>I started with this story because I want you to follow the path of Thomas Jefferson, a path that starts with reading the primary sources and original texts of Islam in an effort to better understand how millions of Muslims interpret their faith.<br> <br>Every day around the world Islamist fanatics are plotting ways to kill us. They do so under the banner of a supremacist ideology that pits Islam against the rest of the world and commands the murder of those who do not willingly submit.<br> <br>It is no understatement to say that Islam has the power to change our way of life. It already has. From mindless security protocols, like toiletries stuffed into clear bags and shoes being removed, at airport checkpoints, to entire parts of the globe now being impenetrable to Western travelers, to an emerging nuclear arms race that threatens global stability, to shaming and silencing those of us who defend freedom of speech, Islam is on a crash course with the free world.<br> <br>The ultimate irony is that, fifteen years after 9/11, we&#x2019;re actually farther away from understanding the threat than we were in the days following the most brutal attack in our history.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why this book is necessary.<br> <br>This work is not meant to be a polemic, but rather an exercise in free inquiry in the tradition of one of our nation&#x2019;s most cherished Founding Fathers. As such, it&#x2019;s going to tell the truth about Islamists and the fundamental things they believe. I&#x2019;ll spare you the political correctness and the pleasant-sounding niceties. The time for worrying about being insensitive or hurting other people&#x2019;s feelings is long past.<br> <br>Put simply, it is about Islam.<br> <br>People do not want you to know that truth. They don&#x2019;t want to hear it. They certainly don&#x2019;t want to discuss it. The mainstream media has essentially ordered a blackout of anything remotely to do with it.<br> <br>When you say that the siege against America under way today is about Islam itself, the PC crowd gasps and says you&#x2019;re attacking a religion, or disrespecting people&#x2019;s right to worship how they choose.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s nonsense. Do Americans have a problem with people worshipping any supreme being they choose? Of course not. Our country was founded on religious freedom. Thomas Jefferson himself ensured that the Constitution protected religious freedom, including for Muslims, Scientologists, Jews, Mormons, Catholics, and everyone else. Our forefathers came here expressly because they wanted every citizen to worship, or not to worship, as they see fit.<br> <br>Is every Muslim in the world predisposed to violence or thinking that America is the Great Satan? Of course not. Does every Muslim in the world share a belief in spreading a Caliphate or support the mandatory implementation of sharia law? Absolutely not. Here in the United States, many Muslims disagree with the radical beliefs of Islamists around the world.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a crucial distinction to be made between Islam and Islamism. When discussing a topic this important, terminology is critical. Islam is the faith of 1.5 billion people around the world. Islamism is the supremacist political ideology that insists on imposing sharia, or Islamic holy law, on the world. Tens of millions of Muslims around the world are Islamists. They include terrorists in groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS&#x2014;variously known as the &#x201c;Islamic State in Iraq and Syria&#x201d; (or Levant, meaning the lands including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel, hence ISIL), and Daesh (the Arabic acronym of ISIS, pronounced &#x201c;desh&#x201d;)&#x2014;but they also include millions more who may not resort to suicide bombings and beheadings but who would like to see people like you and me convert to Islam or else be treated as second-class citizens. There is no such thing as a &#x201c;moderate&#x201d; Islamist.<br> <br>These Islamists&#x2014;people who believe in Islam as a political and governing force&#x2014;are the heart of the problem. They have a clear agenda. They are not trying to hide it. And they are succeeding in executing on it.<br> <br>There are, however, moderate Muslims&#x2014;and while I know this comes off as being overly political correct, it&#x2019;s not an exaggeration to say that they are our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends, and our family members. They are the reformers who seek to make Islam compatible with our individual liberties and freedoms and with a twenty-first-century society. They are also the victims. The Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and other Islamist terrorist groups kill their fellow believers for not being Muslim enough. Thousands of Iraqi and Syrian Muslim Kurds have died fighting the Islamic State and its totalitarianism.<br> <br>But increasingly I fear these Muslims are the exception. But there are troubling signs, including here in America. A June 2015 poll of Muslims living in the United States by the Center for Security Policy showed that a shocking number (51 percent) seek to embrace sharia over the U.S. Constitution. In addition, nearly one in four of Muslims polled believed that &#x201c;it is legitimate to use violence to punish those who give offense to Islam by, for example, portraying the prophet Mohammed.&#x201d; One in five respondents agreed that &#x201c;the use of violence is justified in order to make shariah the law of the land in this country&#x201d; while only 39 percent believed that Muslims in the U.S. should be subjected to American courts.<br> <br>If, as the Pew Research Center estimates, there are approximately 3 million Muslims in America, that translates to roughly half a million U.S. Muslims who believe acts of terror and murder are legitimate tools in order to replace the U.S. Constitution with sharia law.<br></p><h2>God Is Love (Deus Caritas Est)</h2><p>Pope Benedict&#39;s first encyclical seeks to show the place of love in the life of the Church, referencing her charitable activity and works of justice as expressions of love. Examining the natures of various kinds of love--human, divine, eros, friendship, and charity--he inspirationally writes that we were made for love by the God who is love, the God who became one of us out of love, and urges us to purify the love which has been abused in the modern world.</p><p></p><h2>RSN ESG: Crewelwork: Essential Stitch Guides (Royal School of Needlework Essential Stitch Guides)</h2><p>The Royal School of Needlework teaches hand embroidery to the highest standard, developing techniques in new and innovative ways. This book includes an extensive stitch guide, covering all the stitches necessary for crewel embroidery, a design section, and a history of the Royal School itself.</p><p>Jacqui McDonald&#39;s background lies in the conservation and restoration of antiquities and she spent seven years caring for the contents of some of the most beautiful houses in the National Trust. It was here that her passion for embroidery was born. Having been constantly surrounded by beautiful textile furnishings such as tapestries, bed hanging&#39;s, tassels and furniture upholstered in the most exquisite petit point, her inquisitive, artistic and practical nature inevitably led her to recreate items for herself. The passion for her new hobby was so powerful, that it was not long before she made the decision to sacrifice the perfect job to join the Royal school of Needlework&#39;s three-year apprenticeship. The long-term plan was to combine her conservation skills with all the traditional hand embroidery techniques she was learning, to preserve textile heirlooms for the future. Jacqui flourished at the school, and became more confident drawing, designing and working out how to produce ideas with accuracy and precision. On graduating top of the class and attaining a triple distinction, she decided to become a freelance embroiderer and now works from her studio in Hampshire as well as attending the RSN in a teaching role where she enjoys passing on her skills and experiences to others passionate about embroidery. Jacqui&#39;s designs are still heavily influenced by traditional interiors and historical architecture that she enjoyed during her time with the National Trust and whilst studying at Hampton Court Palace."As the author states this is not a book for particular projects and designs, more it shows you how to form your own design and where to look for inspiration." &#x2014;<i>West Country Embroiderers</i> (May 2, 2011)</p><h2>Fight Fat After Forty</h2><p>Discusses the physiological changes that affect women at midlife, at the brink of menopause, and introduces a program that can be tailored to individual needs to help women control stress, boost their metabolism, and control their weight</p><p>If you're a woman over 40, you are undergoing physical and emotional changes, declining metabolism, fat deposits at your waistline, decreased energy, mood swings, food cravings--do we need to continue this list? Now pile on chronic, long-term stress (which the author terms <i>toxic stress</i>), which hits women between 40 and 60 and leads to self-destructive eating behavior. "Uncontrolled or toxic stress keeps the refueling appetite on, thus inducing stress eating and weight gain," Peeke explains. The stress triggers are constant, so the body never gets to turn off the stress response. The weight gained from this chronic, toxic stress--<i>toxic weight</i>--settles inside the abdomen and is associated with heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.<p> Peeke explains the association between stress and fat gain, and describes the stress/eating cycle ("the itch you can't scratch"). Then she teaches tools for "regrouping": formulating and following a contingency plan of nutrition, exercise, and self-care. Next are suggestions for a nutritional plan tied to stressful times of the day and an explanation of food needs after age 40.

This was not a state he was accustomed to; instilled by his father with a sense of daring, Buck was no stranger to adventure, having been (with his brother) one half of the youngest duo to fly across the country, a tale documented in his celebrated book, <em>Flight of Passage</em>. On a whim, he found himself in a museum at the head of the Oregon Trail, realizing that even as a fairly serious American history buff, he knew virtually nothing about the pivotal era when 400,000 pioneers made their way West in quests for land, gold, and new lives. On a much bigger whim, Buck decided to travel the 2,000 miles of ruts and superseding highways in a mule-driven wagon on his own &#x201c;crazyass&#x201d; quest for a new beginning. The result is a dense-yet-entertaining mix of memoir, history and adventure, as Buck-- joined by another brother, Nick, and his &#x201c;incurably filthy&#x201d; dog, Olive Oyl--struggle with the mechanical, environmental, and existential challenges posed by such an unusually grueling journey. Buck is an engaging writer, and while the book pushes 500 pages, the story never lags. By the end, you&#x2019;ll know more about mules than you ever thought you would (just enough, actually), and you&#x2019;ll have a better perspective on the Trail, its travelers, and the role it played in shaping the modern United States. (And is Rinker Buck not a pioneer-worthy name for an tale such as this?)<em>--Jon Foro</em></p>A01</p><h2>Dear Jane: the Two Hundred Twenty-five Patterns from the 1863 Jane A. Stickle Quilt</h2><p>Quilt lovers and Civil War buffs alike will enjoy Dear Jane. It contains all of the 225 patterns of the historic Jane Stickle 1863 quilt as well as a series of letters to Jane about life and times in the nineteenth century, with emphasis on the Civil War and the women&#39;s movement. Among the patterns and letters you will find a dozen quilts from the 1990&#39;s, all inspired by Jane&#39;s supreme example of quilt-making artistry in 1863.</p><p>Brenda has been making quilts since the mid-70&#39;s, especially enjoying drafting and designing. She saw a photo of Jane Stickle&#39;s 1863 quilt and became so enamoured that she spent the next five years researching her life and the times in which she lived. Dear Jane is the result of that labor. In 1997 she retired after teaching math for 25 years to devote her time to lecturing and teaching about Jane Stickle and life in the nineteenth century. She has traveled throughout the United States and also to Japan and Holland. Brenda contributes a bi-monthly article &#34;Quilter&#39;s Workshop&#34; in The Quilter magazine and is currently writing a sequel to Dear Jane.</p><h2>Toward the Future</h2><p>These essays derive from Teilhard's concern to reveal the true meaning of our age and to stimulate the "sense of man and sense of the Christian."

But in <i>A Season on the Reservation</i>, he may have actually learned more than he taught. <p> An outsider at the beginning, Abdul-Jabbar found ways to learn more about his athletes and the tribe. He discovered cultural traditions that made it difficult to coach the team (discomfort at being singled out for criticism, for example) and became more sensitive to the special challenges faced by young Native Americans. As Abdul-Jabbar notes, by working with the students he moved from a historical appreciation for the White Mountain Apaches as a people to an understanding of them as individuals. That said, Abdul-Jabbar can't quite seem to shake his romantic image of the young Apaches: "Sometimes I would glance his way and imagine him sitting astride a paint pony two hundred years earlier, ready to ride off into the mountains and hunt."</p><p> Through his players, Abdul-Jabbar finds himself getting caught up in the competition--his passion for basketball obviously rekindled. Readers may find the end of the Falcons' season rather abrupt, but perhaps that's the nature of high school sports. They also may be a bit put off by Abdul-Jabbar's occasional arrogance, especially when talking about his professional days ("The 1985 Lakers would have taken [Jordan's Bulls] in a championship series.") or when dissing later NBA stars such as Shaq ("He's publicly referred to the way I used to play as 'old man's basketball,' which it may have been, but it earned me six more rings than he's got so far."). Overall, however, <i>A Season on the Reservation</i> is infused with an obvious love of the White Mountain Apaches, their land, and the sport of basketball. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar retired from basketball in 1989.

Wildlife is being lost, not only in the wholesale extinctions of species but also in the dwindling of those species that still exist.<br><br><i>The Moth Snowstorm</i> is unlike any other book about climate change today; combining the personal with the polemical, it is a manifesto rooted in experience, a poignant memoir of the author&#x2019;s first love: nature. McCarthy traces his adoration of the natural world to when he was seven, when the discovery of butterflies and birds brought sudden joy to a boy whose mother had just been hospitalized and whose family life was deteriorating. He goes on to record in painful detail the rapid dissolution of nature&#x2019;s abundance in the intervening decades, and he proposes a radical solution to our current problem: that we each recognize in ourselves the capacity to love the natural world.<br><br>Arguing that neither sustainable development nor ecosystem services have provided adequate defense against pollution, habitat destruction, species degradation, and climate change, McCarthy asks us to consider nature as an intrinsic good and an emotional and spiritual resource, capable of inspiring joy, wonder, and even love. An award-winning environmental journalist, McCarthy presents a clear, well-documented picture of what he calls &#x201c;the great thinning&#x201d; around the world, while interweaving the story of his own early discovery of the wilderness and a childhood saved by nature. Drawing on the truths of poets, the studies of scientists, and the author&#x2019;s long experience in the field, <i>The Moth Snowstorm</i> is part elegy, part ode, and part argument, resulting in a passionate call to action.</p><p><b>Michael McCarthy</b> is known for his award-winning writings on the environment and the natural world, including his book-length works <i>The Moth Snowstorm</i> and <i>Say Goodbye to the Cuckoo</i>. He was the environment correspondent for <i>The Times</i> (London) and later the environment editor at <i>The Independent</i>. He has been the recipient of the Specialist Writer of the Year Award in the British Press Awards, the Medal of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds for &#x201c;outstanding services to conservation,&#x201d; and the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London. He lives in the United Kingdom.&#x201c;McCarthy takes his readers on an idiosyncratic and wonderful walk through his joy of nature. Like some of the greatest nature books, from Thoreau&#x2019;s &#x2018;Walden' to Annie Dillard&#x2019;s 'Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,' it&#x2019;s a personal book that describes McCarthy&#x2019;s own journey while at the same time folding his experiences within a broader context....'The Moth Snowstorm' is an inspiring book, and I salute McCarthy for his boldness. Rather than the dire, dry statistical projections often heralded to make the case for conservation, he turns boldly to joy &#x2014; to imagination and emotion.&#x201d; &#x2014;Andrea Wulf, <i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>"Terrific, original work." &#x2014;Michael Pollan, author of <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i> and <i>In Defense of Food<br><br></i>&#x201c;Mr. McCarthy is certainly a personable companion, prone to bursts of eccentric charm...Filled with beautiful writing...<i>The Moth Snowstorm</i>, however, is much more than a paean to the Earth&#x2019;s beauty. It is also an elegy for it, and a particularly distressed one at that.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jennifer Senior, <i>The New York Times<br><br></i>"An environmental call to arms as powerful as Silent Spring." &#x2014;The Conversation (UK)<br><br>"A chronicle that is both bleak and achingly beautiful; a true treasure." &#x2014;Booklist<br><br>"In this mesmerizing combination of memoir, treatise, and paean to the natural world, British environmental writer McCarthy (Say Goodbye to the Cuckoo) weaves the personal with the political and the local with the global to create a compelling examination of Earth&#x2019;s current ecological crisis...his writing is beautiful, sincere, and powerful.&#x201d; &#x2014;Publishers Weekly, starred review<br><br>"A heartfelt, lovely, and thoroughly lived-through meditation on the natural world and its central part in any civilized life.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kirkus<br><br>&#x201c;A great, rhapsodic, urgent book full of joy, grief, rage, and love. The Moth Snowstorm is at once a deeply affecting memoir and a heartbreaking account of ecological impoverishment.

A must-read.&#x201d; &#x2014;Helen Macdonald, author of H Is for Hawk<br><br>"[McCarthy is] as approachably learned on his subject as you&#x2019;d expect a longtime environmental correspondent to be; but his sentences are long and sensuous&#x2014;great sauntering accumulations of clauses and images, heaving with a poetic yearning to capture the passing abundance of the natural world." &#x2014;Mark O&#x2019;Connell, Slate<br><br>"A beautifully lyrical work, dealing with one of the most urgent problems of our age." &#x2014;Tim Flannery, author of The Weather Makers and Atmosphere of Hope<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;McCarthy has for years been the doyen of environmental correspondents...conversant with the hard facts, the political realities and the moral complexities of the conservation world. But he writes also as a man inspired by the beauty, diversity and abundance of the natural world that we are destroying. This combination of worldly wisdom and deeply felt personal experience makes this a highly original and refreshing account of our current predicament.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jeremy Mynott, The Times Literary Supplement<br><br>"In his beautiful book The Moth Snowstorm, Michael McCarthy suggests that a capacity to love the natural world, rather than merely to exist within it, might be a uniquely human trait. When we are close to nature, we sometimes find ourselves surprised by joy...." &#x2014;George Monbiot, The Guardian<br><br>"This is a book about the joy the natural world can engender&#x2014;even in the face of its decline.

In these stories compiled by Harvey Leake, Wolfkiller shares the ancient wisdom of the Navajo elders that was passed to him while a boy growing up near the Utah/Arizona border. Wolfkiller's story was recorded and translated by pioneer trader Louisa Wade Wetherill, an unlikely pairing that came together when she moved to this remote area of southern Utah in 1906. Wetherill recognized that Wolfkiller was a man of exceptional character, with lessons and wisdom of the Navajo that deserved to be recorded and preserved for the benefit of future generations. </p> <p>Over the course of many years, Wolfkiller told his stories to Wetherill who translated them into English. When the manuscript was completed in 1932, modern society was simply not ready for it. Rejected by publishers, the document languished in the family archives until today, long after Wolfkiller and Mrs. Wetherill were gone, it can now be recognized as a unique and profound book that speaks to modern culture's compulsive rush away from nature. </p> <p>Included are photographs of Wolfkiller and the Wetherills, all taken from about 1906 to 1926. More than forty other historical photographs are also included.</p> <p>"If Mrs. Wetherill could be persuaded to write on the mythology of the Navajos, and also on their present-day psychology-by which somewhat magniloquent term I mean their present ways and habits of thought-she would render an invaluable service. She not only knows their language; she knows their minds. . . ." Theodore Roosevelt, after visiting the Wetherill trading post in 1913</p></p><p><p>Wolfkiller is the remarkable life story of a Navajo herdsman and plant-gatherer who lived in the Monument Valley region of Navajo country, along the Utah/Arizona border, from about 1855 until 1926. Raised by his grandfather and mother, Wolfkiller learned the ancient wisdom of his people. He grew up seeing the beauty in nature and discovering how to face the wind, storms, cold, and even death with optimism and courage. Through his embrace of the natural world, he developed both a rare depth of character and an understanding of human relations that guided him through times of adversity.</p><p>Wolfkiller's story was recorded and translated by pioneer trader Louisa Wade Wetherill, who met him after moving to his community in the early twentieth century. After listening to Wolfkiller describe the wisdom of the elders he had learned as a child and by observing his respect for all of life, Louisa proposed that these lessons be preserved for the benefit of future generations.</p><p>Photographs of Wolfkiller and the Wetherills and other historical images are included throughout the book to help illustrate the mode of life, types of personalities, and environment in which Wolfkiller's story took place. Louisa Wade Wetherill was born in a small mining town in Nevada in 1877. When she was two years old, her family moved to the town of Mancos in southwestern Colorado. There she grew up and married rancher and explorer John Wetherill. In 1900, Louisa, John, and their two small children left Mancos and moved to a trading post among the Navajos in northwestern New Mexico. In 1906, the Wetherills moved to an isolated area in southeastern Utah where they established their Oljato trading post. Among their neighbors was Wolfkiller, a man Louisa quickly came to know and respect. For more than forty years she devoted herself to studying Navajo culture and became an advocate for recording their ancient customs. Her Navajo friends called her Asthon Sosi, Slim Woman.</p><p>Harvey Leake began tracing the trail of his great-grandparents, Louisa and John Wetherill, more than twenty-five years ago in libraries, archives, and family papers, and by listening to the recollections of the family elders. He assists in the interpretation of historical documents and photographs for the Wetherill archive at the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores, Colorado. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from Arizona State University and a Master of Arts degree in theology from Fuller Theological Seminary.</p><p>"If Mrs. Wetherill could be persuaded to write on the mythology of the Navajos . . . she would render an invaluable service.

Now a major motion picture&nbsp;starring Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Lucas Hedges, directed by Joel Edgerton. "Every sentence of the story will stir your soul" (<i>O Magazine</i>).</b></b><br><br>The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality. When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to "cure" him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness. <br><br>By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, <i>Boy Erased</i> is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.</p><p>Garrard Conley is the author of the acclaimed memoir&nbsp;<i>Boy Erased</i>, which has been translated in over a dozen languages and is now a major motion picture. <br><br>Conley is also a creator and producer of the podcast <i>UnErased</i>, which explores the history of conversion therapy in America through interviews, historical documents, and archival materials provided by the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C. <br><br>His work can be found in&nbsp;<i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, <i>TIME</i>,&nbsp;<i>VICE</i>,&nbsp;<i>CNN</i>,&nbsp;<i>BuzzFeed</i>,&nbsp;<i>Them</i>,&nbsp;<i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Huffington Post</i>, among other places.

Told with style and grace and teamed with fresh new illustrations, the story of Wisconsin frontier life in the 1860&#39;s will continue to attract readers today.&#34;--School Library Journal, starred review.</p><p>At age 11, Caddie Woodlawn is the despair of her mother and the pride of her father: a clock-fixing tomboy running wild in the woods of Wisconsin. In 1864, this is a bit much for her Boston-bred mother to bear, but Caddie and her brothers are happy with the status quo. Written in 1935 about Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother's childhood, the adventures of Caddie and her brothers are still exciting over 60 years later. With each chapter comes another ever-more exciting adventure: a midnight gallop on her horse across a frozen river to warn her American Indian friends of the white men's plan to attack; a prairie fire approaching the school house; and a letter from England that may change the family's life forever. This Newbery Medal-winning book bursts at the seams with Caddie's irrepressible spirit. In spite of her mother's misgivings, Caddie is a perfect role model for any girl--or boy, for that matter. She's big-hearted, she's brave, and she's mechanically inclined! <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i><i>Caddie Woodlawn</i>, which has been captivating young readers since 1935, was awarded the John Newbery Medal for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. Now it is in a brand-new edition with lively illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman. In her new foreword, Carol Ryrie Brink lovingly recalls the real Caddie, who was her grandmother, and tells how she often "sat spellbound, listening, listening!" as Caddie told stories of her pioneer childhood. Children everywhere will love redheaded Caddie with her penchant for pranks. Scarcely out of one scrape before she is into another, she refuses to be a "lady," preferring instead to run the woods with her brothers. Whether she is crossing the lake on a raft, visiting an Indian camp, or listening to the tales of the circuit rider, Caddie's adventures provide an exciting and authentic picture of life on the Wisconsin frontier in the 1860s. And readers will discover, as Caddie learns what growing up truly means, that it is not so very different today.

The author demonstrates that all the components of Greek art that were to culminate in the Classical styles of the fifth century can be traced in the development of vase painting in early Greece, from the eleventh to the sixth centuries B.C. The vases are the most prolific source for this study, as well as being invaluable documents of society, religion, trade, and colonization. The works discussed here display the Greek painter&#39;s craft at its most mathematical, its most colorful, and in its most directly narrative mode. The later achievements of Greek art can only be fully understood in light of this formative period of variety, competition, and experiment.</p><p>Sir John Boardman is Lincoln Professor Emeritus of Classical Archaeology at Oxford. His books include the companion volumes Athenian Black Figure Vases, Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Archaic Period, and Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Classical Period.</p><h2>The Royal Palaces of India</h2><p>As early as the fourteenth century, stories glorifying the exotic palaces of Indian rulers began to circulate in the West, stories which closer acquaintance only confirmed. Even today, they are magical places - small towns rather than single buildings, in which the Hindu and Muslim rulers of the subcontinent dispensed their laws and enjoyed their wealth.<br>The beauty and atmosphere of these palaces is displayed here in Antonio Martinelli's exceptional color photographs, composed with the eye of a painter and a trained architect who enjoyed unrivaled access to the buildings. George Michell, a recognized authority on Indian architecture and art, tells the story of the palaces. He evokes life within these complexes and describes their many elements: defenses, spacious audience halls and courtyards, temples and mosques, private apartments and service quarters.<br>At the heart of the book are the palaces themselves. The oldest surviving are those erected by the Muslim conquerors who swept down through the country from the 12th century onwards, notably at Mandu and Bidar. In the north, the Mughals built vast imperial palace-cities at Fatehpur Sikri, Agra and Delhi. The Hindu Rajputs in Central and Western India, where many ruling families have lasted into the modern era, created citadels that are comparatively well preserved - as at Gwalior, Udaipur and Amber. Southern India, another Hindu realm, offers a complete contrast in forms, with the towers of Chandragiri and the breezy timber halls of Padmanabhapuram. Finally, there are the lavish palaces built in the era of British domination, such as Mysore, Baroda and Morvi, some Indian in character, others clothed in dazzling Art Deco.<br>These fascinating edifices are receiving increasing numbers of visitors each year, yet there has been no in-depth survey of them since 1925. Here is a superb record of the palaces, living witnesses to a regal aspiration to recreate heaven on earth.</p><p>A quick perusal illustrates the fact that Indian palaces are most often vast complexes of enormous dimensions. And although ruins outnumber well-maintained structures, Michell animates all the many stunning examples of Hindu and Muslim fortresses and royal residences portrayed in the illuminating photographs. An insightful text offers an overview of India's history as it is revealed through descriptions of various architectural styles and how they developed. Among the book's incredible images are interior details of spectacular carvings, mirror-work patterns, murals, and tile work, and facades are aglow with saturated red sandstone, colored friezes, and copper-wrapped domes punctuating the blue skies surrounding them. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Forever (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 3)</h2><p>The thrilling conclusion to #1 bestselling Shiver trilogy from Maggie Stievater.<br><br>then.<br><br>When Sam met Grace, he was a wolf and she was a girl.

But can one boy and one love really change a hostile, predatory world? The past, the present, and the future will all collide in one pure moment - a moment of death or life, farewell or forever.<br></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2011</strong>: <i>Forever</i> is a fitting finale to the lovely Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy by Maggie Stiefvater (after last year's <em>Linger</em>). This time, the stakes are higher than ever: while Isabel&#x2019;s father plots to wipe out the wolves once and for all, Sam and Isabel search for ways to save the pack, and Cole races to find a cure for Grace. But the real centerpiece of the series is the romance--between Sam and Grace, of course, and between Cole and Isabel--and Stiefvater&#x2019;s luminous, poignant writing does not disappoint. Sam and Grace steal breathtakingly sweet moments together between Grace&#x2019;s unpredictable transformations, and Cole and Isabel struggle to melt each others&#x2019; icy exteriors. Readers will melt, too, and find a satisfying, but not too-perfect, ending to this bestselling saga. <i>--Juliet Disparte</i> <p></p><p></p> <strong>Brenna Yovanoff and Maggie Stiefvater: Author One-on-One</strong> <p> Brenna Yovanoff is is the author of <em>The Replacement</em> and has published in various journals. She lives in Denver, Colorado. Recently she sat down with Maggie Stiefvater to discuss Stiefvater's <em>Ballad</em> and <em>The Wolves of Mercy Falls</em> series. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Maggie interviewed Brenna. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> Even though we all know that characters are not authors, we also know that characters sort of are their authors (at least a little bit). Which of your characters would you say is most like you as a person? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Well, most of my characters are delightfully single-minded, because that is what characters do. So if I were arguing a high-level thesis paper, I&#x2019;d probably declare that, in fact, all of my characters are really me, just exaggerated, stripped of gray areas and less than crystal clear motivations. Even the evil ones. Maybe especially the evil ones. &gt;br/&gt; <br> That said, I&#x2019;ve been told I&#x2019;m quite like Isabel from the <i>Shiver</i> [<i>Wolves of Mercy Falls</i>] series and James from <i>Ballad</i>. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> If Cole from the <i>Shiver</i> trilogy and James from <i>Ballad</i> had to fight each other in a snark-off, who would win?</p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> James, I&#x2019;m afraid. Cole has learned to rely far too much on his appearance to win these things and sometimes, my friends, a finely crafted chin will just not get you ahead in life. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> When your characters are romantically involved, they&#x2019;re willing to fight desperately to be together, often against seemingly insurmountable odds. Like when their significant others turn into wolves and run away into the forest. Where do you stand on the topic of true love? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> I&#x2019;m a fan/ believer/ proponent of true love. I think it&#x2019;s worth waiting for, and I also think it&#x2019;s worth fighting for once you&#x2019;ve found it. I&#x2019;m one of those madly in love people who just doesn&#x2019;t understand why anyone would stand for anything less. I also find long-term dating confusing. I was engaged after a month and a half because, like Grace in <i>Shiver</i>, I am bad at shopping. I just see what I want, and then I go and get it. </p> <p></p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> Cole St. Clair&#x2019;s band Narkotika is, understandably, not a real band. However, if it were a real band, what would it sound like? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Well, I think that Narkotika, like love, is in the eye of the beholder. It&#x2019;s supposed to be an edgy, hard, slightly unsettling band, and that varies depending on what you listen to. Also, it was originally an electronica band (think Blaqk Audio). These days I go through life thinking that possibly they would sound like Ringside. Or Korn. Or Carolina Liar. Or Three Days Grace. I realize that these bands sound nothing like each other. I have no good explanation for that. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> What would you say to all the woefully optimistic girls out there (i.e., me) who want to know if Cole would date them? What if they said please? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Oh, Cole would date you. I guarantee you he would date you. If by &#x201c;date,&#x201d; you mean &#x201c;make out with you in a dark hallway, remove some of your clothing, completely avoid giving you his contact information, disappear, and make you have a resulting existential crisis about why you date boys who treat you badly.&#x201d; <br> <br> The please wouldn&#x2019;t be necessary. </p>Maggie Stiefvater is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the novels Shiver, Linger, Forever, and The Scorpio Races.

Up until the&nbsp;conviction of her husband, Oscar, for homosexual crimes, she had held a privileged position&nbsp;in society. Part of a gilded couple, she was a popular children's author, a fashion icon, and a&nbsp;leading campaigner for women's rights. A founding member of the magical society The&nbsp;Golden Dawn, her pioneering and questioning spirit encouraged her to sample some of the&nbsp;more controversial aspects of her time. Mrs. Oscar Wilde was a phenomenon in her own&nbsp;right. But that spring Constance's entire life was eclipsed by scandal. Forced to flee to the&nbsp;Continent with her two sons, her glittering literary and political career ended abruptly. She&nbsp;lived in exile until her death.&nbsp;</p><p>Franny Moyle now tells Constance's story with a fresh eye. Drawing on numerous&nbsp;unpublished letters, she brings to life the story of a woman at the heart of fin-de-siecle&nbsp;London and the Aesthetic movement. In a compelling and moving tale of an unlikely couple&nbsp;caught up in a world unsure of its moral footing, Moyle unveils the story of a woman who&nbsp;was the victim of one of the greatest betrayals of all time.</p></p><p>Franny Moyle&nbsp;has a degree in English and History of Art from St John's College, Cambridge,&nbsp;and is the author of&nbsp;Desperate Romantics. She was a leading arts producer at the BBC,&nbsp;which culminated in her becoming the corporation's first Commissioner for Arts and Culture,&nbsp;and is now a freelance writer in London.A new trend in biography is to profile the woman behind the man. In the case of the immensely talented and tragically infamous Oscar Wilde, that woman was the beautiful, intelligent, and forward-thinking Constance Lloyd Wilde. Although Oscar&#x2019;s sexual preferences were decidedly male, his marriage, in many ways, was a union of like minds and mutual respect. Constance, an author in her own right, a proponent of the rational dress movement, and a budding spiritualist, was, like her husband, on the cutting edge of more liberal Victorian trends. After Oscar&#x2019;s incarceration for gross indecency in 1895, she was forced to flee to the Continent, where she and her children lived in exile until her premature death at 39 in 1898. Moyle does a great job of setting the scene, firmly grounding her subject in a society and a social order teetering on the edge of a remarkable transformation that unfortunately arrived too late for herself and her family. --Margaret Flanagan</p><h2>A Tzaddik in Our Time: The Life of Rabbi Aryeh Levin</h2><p>The biography of the beloved Jerusalem rabbi who devoted his life to helping his fellow Jews, and was especially active in aiding those imprisoned by the British.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew</p><h2>Journey of a Thousand Miles: My Story</h2><p>&#x201c;Number One&#x201d; was a phrase my father&#x2014;and, for that matter, my mother&#x2014;repeated time and time again.

There was the Number One leader of a manufacturing plant, the Number One worker, the Number One scientist, the Number One car mechanic. In the culture of my childhood, being best was everything. It was the goal that drove us, the motivation that gave life meaning. And if, by chance or fate or the blessings of the generous universe, you were a child in whom talent was evident, Number One became your mantra. It became mine. I never begged my parents to take off the pressure. I accepted it; I even enjoyed it. It was a game, this contest among aspiring pianists, and although I may have been shy, I was bold, even at age five, when faced with a field of rivals.<br><br>Born in China to parents whose musical careers were interrupted by the Cultural Revolution, Lang Lang has emerged as one of the greatest pianists of our time. Yet despite his fame, few in the West know of the heart-wrenching journey from his early childhood as a prodigy in an industrial city in northern China to his difficult years in Beijing to his success today.<br><br><i>Journey of a Thousand Miles </i>documents the remarkable, dramatic story of a family who sacrificed almost everything&#x2014;his parents&#x2019; marriage, financial security, Lang Lang&#x2019;s childhood, and their reputation in China&#x2019;s insular classical music world&#x2014;for the belief in a young boy&#x2019;s talent. And it reveals the devastating and intense relationship between a boy and his father, who was willing to go to any length to make his son a star.<br><br>An engaging, informative cultural commentator who bridges East and West, Lang Lang has written more than an autobiography: his book opens a door to China, where Lang Lang is a cultural icon, at a time when the world&#x2019;s attention will be on Beijing. Written with David Ritz, the coauthor of many bestselling autobiographies, <i>Journey of a Thousand Miles</i> is an inspiring story that will give readers an appreciation for the courage and sacrifice it takes to achieve greatness.</p><p>LANG LANG was born in 1982 in Shenyang, China. He has played with the leading orchestras in all of the major concert halls throughout the world. <br><br>DAVID RITZ is a bestselling music writer who has cowritten autobiographies with Ray Charles, Smokey Robinson, Aretha Franklin, and B.B. King, among others.<b>Revolution</b><br>The Cultural Revolution, which spread over a decade beginning in 1966, had an enormous impact on practically every person in China. I was born on June 14, 1982, some six years after the Revolution had ended, and I still felt its enormous reverberations. The Revolution was a large-scale, society-wide social and political upheaval in which all students and intellectuals, including musicians and artists, were sent away from the cities to labor on farms and learn from the peasants. Millions of professionals were forced to leave their homes. China was to be self-reliant and was closed to the West.<br><br>When I was around seven years old, I began asking my mother questions about our family's past. One night, while my father was at his job policing the nightclubs and entertainment district of Shenyang, and after I had completed my long practice session on the piano, my mother sat down next to me, handing me slices of fresh oranges and a glass of cool water. It didn't take much prodding to get her to start talking about her youth.<br><br>I loved listening to my mother's stories. Because she had been a singer and an actress at her school, she spoke theatrically, with bubbly enthusiasm and great dramatic pauses. As she told me the story of her life, and my father's, and how their lives intertwined, music in my head accompanied each tale--ever since I can remember, I have had a kind of soundtrack playing in my head, accompanying my life's most memorable moments. I heard etudes and concertos, sonatas and great symphonies. I heard the harmonies and counterpoints. I heard the action of the music. To me, music was action. And my parents' lives were action packed, the stuff of drama and thrilling music.<br><br>"Music," said my mother, "was an early love in my life. Music always lifted my spirits and brought me joy."<br><br>Mom told me how, when she was four, her parents moved the family--her and her three brothers--from Dandong on the coast of North Korea to Shenyang in the north of China, where her father worked as a highly skilled technician in an iron plant and her mom became a bookkeeper. Her grandfather loved to sing songs from the Peking opera, so music filled the house.<br><br>"What about my grandmother?" I asked. "Why don't I know her?"<br><br>"She died of a lung disease when I was young."<br><br>"How young?" I asked.<br><br>"I was nine."<br><br>My heart started beating like crazy--I was suddenly terrified. "Will you die when I become nine?"<br><br>"Oh no, darling," she assured me. "I'll always be here with you."<br><br>"Were you scared?" I asked.<br><br>"Yes, I was afraid. Being the only daughter, I was so close to my mother. Losing her hurt a great deal. I was afraid of living without her."<br><br>"Then what happened?"<br><br>"The world went on," said my mother. "The world always goes on."<br><br>Her father excelled at his job in the ironworks factory. He invented a device that improved manufacturing efficiency, and he was rewarded accordingly. My mother went to school and did well; they were all bright students in her family. At school, she began acting in little plays, singing, and dancing. Then, in 1966, came the Cultural Revolution--and everything changed.<br><br>Mom's paternal grandfather was a landlord, even though my mother had never seen this "land." Though her father was a successful inventor and invaluable technician at the ironworks factory, he was now considered untrustworthy and was supervised closely. Rumors circulated that my grandfather was conspiring against the Cultural Revolution. Of course, the rumors were false, but they persisted. To protect Mom and her brothers from worry, her father never mentioned any of this. They only found out when a friend came to their house one day and cried out, "They have your father in the fools' parade!" My mother didn't even know what that meant, but of course she ran outside to see. On the street, a group of men was being forced to march from the factory, her father among them. They were all wearing dunces' hats and holding up big cards with words Mom didn't understand. She wanted to run to him, but he was surrounded by guards. That night her father didn't return home. She wept like an infant. When he finally showed up the next morning, she ran to him. "Why are they doing this to you?" she demanded. "Have you made a mistake?" "I have made no mistake," said my grandfather. "I have done nothing wrong. But these are changing times with new people in charge who persecute me even though they don't know me."<br><br>Her father was reinstated at the factory but was demoted, and he was no longer recognized or respected. My mother felt the community's contempt most keenly in school. Her classmates were being chosen to serve in the Red Guard, which was an honor for young boys and girls. Those selected wore a special red scarf, but because of her father Mom was forbidden to wear one. She was a good singer, though, so despite their scorn, they wanted her to perform for the school. During her performances, she was given the red scarf to wear, but when they were over, the scarf was taken from her. Boys from her school would chase her down the hall and curse at her. They never expected her to answer them, but she always did. She cursed them right back. She may have been wounded by their hatred, but she was not shy or weak. She had dreams and ambitions.<br><br>"What kinds of dreams, Mother?" I asked.<br><br>"Dreams of joining a professional dance or music group. Dreams of acting. When I was on that stage, it didn't matter what anyone thought of me--up there, I was invincible."<br><br>Mom had imagination and talent. She could feel the story behind the lyrics of songs and make that story come alive. She could transform herself into different characters. She could lose herself in a costume drama, or a song from another century, or a choreography arranged decades before her birth. Onstage she felt free, and she had high hopes of becoming a professional. The military recruited actresses and singers to entertain the troops of the People's Liberation Army. At that time, the military was the most important power, and to play before the generals was the biggest honor. My mother had every reason to believe that she would be chosen. Her teachers recommended her highly. Her colleagues all said she was the number one actress, dancer, and singer in her school. And yet she was rejected.<br><br>"My father's family were landlords, and landlords--even the granddaughters of landlords--could not be trusted during the Revolution," my mother told me. "My schooling ended, and so did my dreams . . ." My mother and her three brothers were sent away from their father--my mother to work on a farm, and her brothers to labor in different villages. One of her brothers was a talented Peking Opera singer, but his career was ended during the Revolution.<br><br>I loved listening to my mother talk. Inevitably, though, her stories would come to an end, and she would tell me to go practice. I was working on pieces by Chopin and Liszt that other students didn't attempt until they were thirteen or fourteen, and I was excited by the challenge. But as my fingers moved over the keys, my mind would move over the stories my mother had told me about my family. I was proud that she hadn't allowed the boys in her school to intimidate her. I was grateful for her strength, and I believed she was the artist she had hoped to become. I practiced to make up for her missed opportunities, until I conquered the music just as she had conquered her enemies. The music became a soundtrack to a movie about my mother.<br><br>At our small dinner table, she served me the food I loved best, hot dumplings and sauerkraut with pork. My father worked late, so she and I would often eat alone, and I would urge her to continue her stories.<br><br>She told me how she and my father had met in 1977, when they were both twenty-four years old. The Cultural Revolution had ended, and because of her excellent work on the farmland she was allowed to return to Shenyang. She had just begun her job as a telephone operator at the Institute of Science, and my father was working at a factory during the day. But my father's dream was to become a professional musician. He played the erhu, a two-stringed fiddle, the most popular traditional instrument in China, which in a traditional orchestra plays a similar role to the violin in a Western orchestra. Although his dream to enter the music conservatory had not been realized because the conservatories had been closed during the Cultural Revolution, he had found part-time work playing with an acrobatic circus band, and sometimes he traveled with them. But the job wasn't stable.<br><br>On their first date, my father took my mother to the movies to see a Russian film. Afterward, he told his friends that he was 100 percent satisfied with her appearance and her personality.<br>I asked my mother if she had been 100 percent satisfied with my father.<br><br>"I can't say I was--certainly not at first. My ideal man was a little taller, a little more dashing than your father, more talkative, and with a warmer personality. And a little more established in his line of work."<br><br>I asked if my grandfather liked him, and Mother couldn't help but laugh. She told me how her father had warned her, saying, "This man has no future, no profession. You will not be satisfied with him." My grandfather forbade my mother to date my father, but my dad was persistent. He kept asking my mother out. In spite of her father's disapproval, she agreed to meet Dad secretly on several occasions. One evening when she came home, her father spotted Dad walking her to the door. Infuriated, my grandfather slapped my mother across the face. According to Mom, this was the only time her father ever raised a hand to her.<br><br>After that, she stopped seeing my father, but it was as much his own doing...</p><h2>Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis (Faber Pocket Poetry)</h2><p>Page edges tanned, owner&#39;s inscription.

He is a director of the Ian Fleming Foundation.This latest addition to the James Bond canon includes virtually all the requisite components, from an evil villain with a diabolical plot to exotic settings and beautiful women. But what's missing is the biggest piece of all: Bond himself. This time around, Benson's Bond is strangely inert; he lacks the suavity, verve and wit that have made him one of the most engaging heroes in genre fiction. The story line is compelling enough: 007 is in Japan to baby-sit the British prime minister at a summit conference and to investigate mysterious deaths in the McMahon family, whose patriarch ran pharmaceutical giant CureLab. Bond reunites with an aging Tiger Tanaka, who featured in Ian Fleming's You Only Live Twice, as they pursue Goro Yoshida, the terrorist who links both parts of Bond's mission. Yoshida is a clich&#x201a; monomaniacal and merciless but an interesting one, bent on using biological weapons to punish Western society for polluting traditional Japanese culture. He even has an evil dwarf sidekick, Junji Kon, the knife-wielding embodiment of a kappa, a mythical creature in Japanese folklore. The other Bond tropes are present: love interests (Reiko Tamura, Tanaka's colleague; and Mayumi, the sole survivor of the McMahon family), cinematic action and gadgets (including a Palm Pilot packed with plastic explosive). But it's Bond himself who propels readers along, and here he is a mere facsimile of the real thing.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sweets: Soul Food Desserts and Memories [A Baking Book]</h2><p><b>A beautifully photographed cookbook of sugary sweet soul food desserts, influenced by the women in author Patty Pinner's family.</b><br><br>Growing up in a large African-American family in a small town in Michigan, Patty Pinner spent her childhood helping the women of the house-the Queens of Soul Food-whip up the sweet treats that crowned family dinners, neighborhood gatherings, and church socials.

Canvas tents were their domains, hot Middle Eastern deserts their gardens of inquiry and labor. Thanks to them, prevailing ideas about feminine nature &#x2014; soft, nurturing, submissive &#x2014; were upended. <i>Ladies of the Field</i> tells the story of seven remarkable women, each a pioneering archaeologist, each headstrong, smart, and courageous, who burst into what was then a very young science. Amanda Adams takes us with them as they hack away at underbrush under a blazing sun, battle swarms of biting bugs, travel on camelback for weeks on end, and feel the excitement of unearthing history at an archaeological site. Adams also reveals the dreams of these extraordinary women, their love of the field, their passion for holding the past in their hands, their fascination with human origins, and their utter disregard for convention.</p><p><b>Amanda Adams</b> is a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley and holds a master&#x2019;s degree in anthropology from the University of British Columbia. She is the author of one previous work of nonfiction, <i>A Mermaid&#x2019;s Tale: A Personal Search for Love and Lore</i>.<br>From Chapter 7<br><br>Like a Glass of Stony White Wine<br>Dorothy Garrod<br><br>***<br><br>By the late 1920s, archaeology had evolved from a passionate (even personal) pursuit of the past to a purer science. The field had matured since Amelia Edwards boarded her <i>dahabeeyeh</i> and Gertrude Bell explored uncharted deserts alone. The lush travel narratives that described archaeological expedition as adventure were fading away. They became less popular, less useful to a science reaching for ever more precise answers. In the early twentieth century there was a new voice for archaeology, and it was Dorothy Garrod.<br><br>Take the following as an example. In the passage below Garrod offers a technical description of wind-borne sands that would have inspired Amelia&#x2019;s pen to heady prose musing on those bits of ancient earth snatched by a swinging gale, bound in heavenly light. Garrod was a little more straightforward: The sands and travertines at Devil's Tower are clearly wind-borne. Apart from their contents the way in which layer 1 was driven up against the face of the rock and into the roof of the fissure demonstrates this beyond question.&#x201d;<br><br>Here was the new tone of archaeology concise and clear, grounded in facts, leanly expressed. Objective. The older accounts of the field that melded travelogue and discovery in equal measure were laid to rest, relegated to literary artifact. They were appreciated to be sure (they were the written foundations of the field), but personal memoir no longer had a place in an archaeological survey report.<br><br>In the beginning archaeology served the personal taste of the researcher; it was a kind of intellectual pursuit sidesaddled to the exotic. Now archaeology was the thing served; served by scientists willing to leave out any mention of themselves. The spotlight shone exclusively on a site, the evidence found, and the conclusions drawn. Archaeology was suddenly selfless. People were still proud to put their names on reports, build reputable careers, and drum up recognition for their scholarly finesse, but the stories of individual experience and romance were relegated to the discipline&#x2019;s backwaters. The goal had shifted from entertainment to information testing and building.<br><br>Archaeology had at last dug out its place as a credible international science. With so much evidence coming to light, ranging from buried towns like Gournia to ancient bones that revealed the intricacies of our human evolution, the questions archaeology could ask were becoming more pointed. The stakes were higher, the answers more complex yet increasingly within reach. A new generation of archaeologists set aside the once colorful tales of adventure and got down to a different kind of business.<br><br>***<br><br>One of these archaeologists was Dorothy Garrod. She tackled archaeology the way a physicist might break down the structure of a proton; she was thorough and methodical and had an eye fastened to detail. Her good friend, Gertrude Caton-Thompson (1888 1985), another notable early woman archaeologist, referred to a Garrod tradition of eminence in the advancement of scientific learning.&#x201d; Garrod came from brainy stock a family of important scientists. Though a woman, she matched precedent and eventually won recognition as a towering figure&#x201d; in archaeological history, one who exerted an enormous intellectual legacy.&#x201d; Her lasting influence in the field was as deep as the sites she dug. Standing on the edge of an excavation unit in the Paleolithic cave site of Tabun in Palestine, Garrod gazed down at a cleared span of nearly 600,000 years of human history, a layer cake of history made of old hearth ash, tools, bones, and crumbled red ocher, all cascading beneath her boots in varying shades of soil.<br><br>Her quest was prehistory human origins and the first seeds of agriculture, to be specific and she considered the revolutionary new discoveries of early man (yes, women too) throughout Europe and beyond the very life-blood of our science.&#x201d; She seized the opportunities available in new dating methods (radiocarbon), constructed new and reliable chronologies, led complicated field excavations, found some of the earliest evidence for domestication of the dog, and became the first female professor at Cambridge University. She worked with leading men of the day as a highly respected colleague, if not a leader. Her training was tough one mentor made her place her hand in a bag, feel the stone tools, and identify them by touch alone and she traveled far and wide to work in the cave sites where our ancestors once lit warm fires during a dark and cold Ice Age.<br><br>Like the women archaeologists who came before her, Garrod traveled to remote corners of the earth under harsh conditions in some regions she couldn&#x2019;t go anywhere without an armed escort yet this legendary woman remains a little opaque to the public eye. Highly reserved, she didn&#x2019;t showcase her personal life or write a string of gushing letters home, and until recently, very few photographs of Garrod were known to exist. So little personal information was available that for years rumors claimed she had burned everything notebooks, pictures, letters, and sketches.<br><br>***<br><br> Dorothy was unique, rather like a glass of pale fine stony French white wine.&#x201d; That was the way one colleague characterized her. Another gave a nod to her sound judgment,&#x201d; explaining that Garrod was a good mixer, with a genuine interest in people, whatever their age, status, or diversified affairs. Her retentive memory, wide reading and interest outside her own subject, such as music (she played the violin and flute), fitted her to contribute something of interest, fun, or wit to most type of conversation.&#x201d; <i>But</i>, if bored or displeased she could be devastatingly silent, sultry, abrupt, or unco-operative.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet another portrait of Garrod gives us a woman both reserved, assured, delightful&#x201d; in the field, and frightened, ill at ease&#x201d; in hierarchical situations or when giving public lectures. Evidently, she was tricky to read and sensitive to circumstance.<br><br>An obituary written for her noted that partly through natural reticence, partly through social conventions of earlier life, she seldom alluded in general conversation, professional circles apart, to her own work and position, or to the international community of distinguished scientists in which, by inheritance and personal achievement she moved so easily.&#x201d; She was quiet, modest, some said shy. By the list of her extensive publications, she was busy too.<br><br>Garrod was born on May 5, 1892. Her grandfather was knighted Sir Alfred Garrod. He was a professor at King&#x2019;s College Hospital and was later endowed with the fancy title of Physician Extraordinary to Queen Victoria. He had three sons, two of whom became outstanding scientists and the third a poet. Garrod had a zoologist uncle, and her father, Sir Archibald Edward Garrod, was famous for pioneering a new field of medicine dealing with metabolic troubles. He was Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and honorary member of countless medical institutions clubs and organizations at home and abroad. The Garrod household kindled the scientific spirit, which, in the words of Dorothy Garrod&#x2019;s famous father, acts as a check as well as a stimulus, a spirit restraining too eager flights of the imagination and too hasty conclusions.&#x201d; This spirit of restraint deeply influenced Garrod&#x2019;s approach to archaeology.<br><br>By the grace of so many clever minds in the family, the Garrods enjoyed social prestige and upper class wealth and comfort. Although little information exists about Garrod&#x2019;s mother, Laura Elizabeth Smith, it is known that she had a scientific upbringing also. Her father was a surgeon famed for the dexterity of his hands. That attribute was passed onto Garrod, holding her in good stead when she would one day gently lift fragile human bones out of clingy clay-rich earth.<br></p><h2>Lose Weight the Smart Low-Carb Way: 200 High-Flavor Recipes and a 7-Step Plan to Stay Slim Forever</h2><p>From Atkins to The Zone, low-carbohydrate diets have taken the country by storm.

Was he a mythological figure? Or was he a real, historical person? Such questions have provoked interest among historians and authors for centuries. In Oedipus and Akhnaton, Immanuel Velikovsky identifies the scene and all the personages of the Greek Oedipus legend with the life patterns of the family of the Egyptian King Akhnaton, reputedly the first monotheist during the most famous famous period of Egyptian history. As a feat in unraveling myth, lore, and fact, Immanuel Velikovsky&#39;s startling new approach can be likened to the evidence of Schliemann&#39;s discovery of the Minoan civilization, or the deciphering of Mycenean. The legend of the Oedipus cycle, in which Dr. Velikovsky finds a parallel to the House of Akhnaton, involves the family of Oedipus, King of Thebes - his blinding and exile, his curse on his sons who subsequently slew each other at the gates of Thebes, and the courage of his daughter, Antigone, who entombed her fallen brother despite contrary official decree and was herself immured in a pit-tomb as punishment. This tale, filled with suspense, becomes even more compelling as it is related to historical fact.</p><p></p><h2>The Pinecone: The Story of Sarah Losh, Forgotten Romantic Heroine--Antiquarian, Architect, and Visionary</h2><p><p>In the village of Wreay, near Carlisle, stands the strangest and most magical Victorian church in England. This vivid, original book tells the story of its builder, Sarah Losh, strong-willed, passionate, and unusual in every way.</p><p>Sarah Losh is a lost Romantic genius&#x2015;an antiquarian, an architect, and a visionary. Born into an old Cumbrian family, heiress to an industrial fortune, Losh combined a zest for progress with a love of the past. In the church, her masterpiece, she let her imagination flower&#x2015;there are carvings of ammonites, scarabs, and poppies; an arrow pierces the wall as if shot from a bow; a tortoise-gargoyle launches itself into the air. And everywhere there are pinecones in stone. The church is a dramatic rendering of the power of myth and the great natural cycles of life, death, and rebirth.</p><p>Losh's story is also that of her radical family, friends of Wordsworth and Coleridge; of the love between sisters and the life of a village; of the struggles of the weavers, the coming of the railways, the findings of geology, and the fate of a young northern soldier in the First Afghan War. Above all, it is about the joy of making and the skill of unsung local craftsmen. Intimate, engrossing, and moving, <i>The Pinecone</i>, by Jenny Uglow, the Prize-winning author of <i>The Lunar Men</i>, brings to life an extraordinary woman, a region, and an age.</p></p><p><p><b>Jenny Uglow</b>'s books include prizewinning biographies of Elizabeth Gaskell and William Hogarth. <i>The Lunar Men</i>, published in 2002, was described by Richard Holmes as "an extraordinarily gripping account," while <i>Nature's Engraver </i>won the National Arts Writers Award for 2007. <i>A Gambling Man </i>was short-listed for the 2010 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction. Uglow grew up in Cumbria and now lives in Canterbury, England.</p>1 The Walk <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>In mid-March the Cumbrian skies are sometimes a clear, cutting blue. At noon, the sun holds a faint touch of warmth, but it is cold, half a season behind the southern counties. Snowdrops are still out and wild daffodils just in bud. Sitting on the low wall with its rounded arches, around the enclosure of family graves, on a March day in 1850, Sarah Losh could feel snow in the breeze as she listened to the children&#x2019;s voices from the school across the road that she and her sister Katharine had built long ago. From here Sarah could survey her kingdom. At her back was her church and in front of her the broad green oval on the slope of the hill was ringed with her works. The buildings with their ancient forms looked now like part of the landscape, as if they had always been here. On the brow of the hill, she could see the wall of the new cemetery that she had given to the village, the mortuary chapel, standing out against the skyline, and the sexton&#x2019;s cottage beside it. Then the road dipped back to the churchyard, past the little dame school down to the cottages and the blacksmith&#x2019;s shop and the Plough Inn, before plunging towards the river Petteril in the valley. <br>Her first task, when she began to plan her church, had been to move the lane that cut across the north of the churchyard to the other side, so that it circled the whole domain. The process was slow, following set customs. First she had to gain the agreement of the Twelve Men of Wreay, the landowners and farmers who had run village affairs since the Restoration, using the rents of parish land to pay the schoolmaster, administering local charities and acting as guardians of the poor. Every Candlemas Eve, before the quarter day that falls on 2 February, they met at the Plough at six in the evening to conduct their business, then paid a shilling for their supper of bread, cheese, oatcake, butter and ale, lit their churchwarden pipes and filled their tankards before they told tales, sang ballads and recited poetry. They were &#x2018;the Township&#x2019;, and convivial or not, they took their role seriously. In notes and petitions in the early eighteenth century the men asked for the schoolmaster to be made a deacon so that he could administer baptisms and visit the sick.1 Sarah&#x2019;s great-grandfather, William Losh, was one of the signatories to this petition, and in the year of her birth the list of the Twelve Men included both her grandfather and her father. <br>The vicar, William Gaskin, who had lived with her family before his marriage, when he was a young curate, had recorded the meetings of the Twelve Men in his leather-bound notebook since 1786, when she was born. In her own notes describing the building of the church Sarah explained that the plot of land on which it stood was &#x2018;anciently part of the common belonging to the Township&#x2019; and when Wreay Common was enclosed in 1778, &#x2018;this was hedged in to form a cow grassing&#x2019; for the parish clerk. The original church on the common was a long, low building dating back to the time of Edward II: in 1319 the bishop allowed a chaplain here.2 The district was known as the Chapelry of Wreay, a sub-parish of St Mary&#x2019;s abbey in Carlisle, and villagers always referred to the church simply as &#x2018;the chapel&#x2019;. In 1739 it was reconsecrated as St Mary&#x2019;s of Wreay and since 1750 burials had been allowed here, relieving the families of the arduous custom of carrying the corpse to the mother church in Carlisle. <br>When Sarah persuaded the Twelve Men to hand the land over to her in 1836, their action, she said, enabled her &#x2018;to improve the appearance of the place by planting it with evergreens and also to rebuild, with a little additional space, the wall of the chapel yard, which had almost wholly disappeared&#x2019;. It seemed a reasonable and modest exchange, a gracious act by a local benefactor. But more was to come. &#x2018;June twentieth, 1836&#x2019;, the minutes declared in a looping hand, &#x2018;Resolved unanimously that leave be granted to Miss Losh to divert the Road to the West end of the Chapel yard&#x2019;. But moving the road, although no one noted this at the time, also left her room to build a new church. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>For many years the villagers remembered Sarah in her black cloak and bonnet, walking from the church to her home at Woodside, a good mile away. At the brow of the hill, where she could lean on the gate to the sexton&#x2019;s cottage, Wreay lay behind her in a sheltered curve on the side of the ridge that blocked the view to the west. To the east, though, the view suddenly widened: across the valleys of the Petteril and the Eden, the long shoulders of the Pennines sloped northwards from the heights of Cross Fell, still covered in snow, towards Carrock Fell, the small town of Brampton and the Newcastle road. She knew the name of every field she passed, for she owned them all, over six hundred acres on both sides of the road, as far as the hamlets of Brisco and Upperby, almost up to Carlisle. <br>The old road, known as Waygates, ran straight as an arrow. Before the enclosures of the late eighteenth century &#x2013; from which the Loshes gained considerably &#x2013; this had been a track across common land, crossing others at right angles with no need to circle awkwardly round private property. It was unusually wide, so that haycarts could pass, avoiding ruts and boggy patches. One half of it was paved and the other half was left as common. Canon Hall, the vicar of Wreay in the early twentieth century, remembered this wide margin as &#x2018;a wild tangle of gorse, sallows, brambles, honeysuckle, and dog roses, with meadow sweet, peppermint, orchids, and other flowers below&#x2019;. In spring there were violets and dog&#x2019;s mercury, in autumn it was red with haws and hips, and in winter the snow lay deep and frozen. <br>The road ran past the farms of Wood House and Low Hurst, then down through a small wood, across the beck and up the hill to Woodside. The old house, set at right angles to the road, stood on a spur of land with views to all points of the compass. The effect of an airy plateau was strengthened by the way the grass was banked up to the top of the wall so that the road was hidden and the eye passed straight across to the fields and trees of the West Park: on a clear day you could see the Caldbeck Fells and the back of Saddleback, northern sentinel of the Lakes. Across the hidden ditch of the ha-ha, the view stretched across the pond and clumps of trees in the North Park to the hazy land of the borders; to the east lay the Pennines, and to the south Woodside&#x2019;s windows gazed across terraced lawns to the heights of Cross Fell. <br>A leisurely walk on the Woodside lawns, from William Hutchinson&#x2019;s <i>History of Cumberland</i>, published in 1794, when Sarah was eight. <br>The Loshes had lived at Woodside for generations and her grandfather John had turned the old house into a Georgian mansion, with sweeping lawns and open views. A sundial stood in the garden, marked &#x2018;1757&#x2019;, two years after his marriage. When her parents John and Isabella married in 1785, her grandparents moved to a house in Fisher Street in Carlisle, leaving Woodside to them. Sarah was born on New Year&#x2019;s Day 1786, and baptised six days later in St Cuthbert&#x2019;s, Carlisle. This was where all the family worshipped when they were in the city, where her parents had married and where her grandparents were buried within a week of each other in April 1789 &#x2013; Catherine dying first and the Squire tumbling after. <br>Sarah was three when her grandfather died, but stories abounded of this huge, rumbustious man, twenty stone or more, with a roaring voice and bellowing laugh, fair-haired and red-faced, known as the Big Black Squire after the black stallion he rode. The Loshes were not among the grandest landowners but they were friends with all the powerful local families: the Blamires of Thackwood, a few miles away; the Hudlestons of Hutton John to the south; the Aglionbys of Nunnery; and the three branches of the Howard family, at Greystoke Castle, Corby and Naworth. They knew the Christians of Cockermouth and the magnates of the coast, like the Curwens of Workington Hall, who combined collieries with farming, the Senhouses of Netherhall, who had developed the fishing village of Maryport into a thriving port, and the Spedding families of Whitehaven and Bassenthwaite. Beyond this the marriages of the Squire&#x2019;s sisters brought connections with other well-known local names which would be marked in the margins of Sarah&#x2019;s life: Parkers, Bells and Wilsons.3 <br>The Squire married pretty, charming Catherine Liddell, a woman less than half his size. She came from Burgh-by-Sands &#x2013; or &#x2018;Bruff&#x2019; in local speech &#x2013; where the flat lands and creeks at the mouth of the Eden merged into the misty wastes of the Solway Firth. They were a sociable couple and they and their children were great favourites in Carlisle society. John was born in 1757, the eldest of nine children, eight boys and a girl, Margaret. The Loshes had their share of family tragedies: one of a pair of twins died within a week and their second son, William, died aged ten, after a fall from a tree while bird-nesting. Then just before John married, his brother Joseph, a young dragoons officer, died in Gloucester: there were lasting rumours of a duel, but his violent fever seems to have stemmed not from wounds but from heatstroke in the fierce July sun. Three years later Margaret&#x2019;s twin brother Robert collapsed in Newcastle when he was nineteen, after a walking match &#x2018;which, however, he won&#x2019;.4 These shadows hovered over Sarah&#x2019;s childhood. But when she was growing up her aunt Margaret and her uncles James and George, still in their twenties, and another William, who was fourteen when she was born, were vibrantly alive. <br>Their world was far from cut off in the late 1780s, however much their family friend Kitty Senhouse might lament that travel was so difficult: &#x2018;The mail being overturn&#x2019;d does not surprise one as I believe accidents often happen to it unknown to anyone but those who have the misfortune of sharing in them &#x2013; for the obvious reason that if it was known nobody would be foolhardy enough to trust so dangerous a conveyance.&#x2019;5 The Loshes had a house in London and business interests in Newcastle and Edinburgh and their sons travelled the world. The Squire was interested in new scientific ideas and friendly with the intellectuals of the cathedral close. His plans for his sons followed a standard pattern for the landed gentry: the eldest, John, would inherit the land; the next, James, would go into the church; the third &#x2013; the ill-fated Joseph &#x2013; into the army. The younger sons, Robert, George and William, would make their way in trade. As far as that was concerned, there were already good openings in Newcastle. Their mother Catherine had useful family connections with the Liddells of Ravensworth, powerful coal owners and merchants who were prominent in the politics of the Tyne. <br>John and his brothers had a radical, adventurous streak and looked far beyond Carlisle. All were talented linguists, studying abroad in France and Germany and the Low Countries, lovers of literature, filling the old house with books. They were born into a new age of improvement, science, law, industry and reform. Like many Cumbrians of their generation, their futures lay on the quays of Newcastle as much as in the markets of Carlisle. <br>Cumberland, from the Lyson brothers&#x2019; <i>Magna Britannia</i>, 1816. <br>After his father died, John was head of the family, technically responsible for his younger brothers &#x2013; although in the event it was James, the second son, who worried about their lives and sorted out their problems. Until they were sixteen James and John were both taught at home by the curate William Gaskin, whom James summed up as a man of &#x2018;considerable powers of mind&#x2019;, who had studied law and was a good classical scholar, despite being uncouth in his manners and abrupt in his speech.6 From Wreay they went to be tutored by John Dawson, a brilliant, self-taught doctor and mathematician who took private pupils at Sedbergh, on the edge of the Yorkshire dales. Dawson&#x2019;s story became part of local lore: the poor boy from Garsdale in Yorkshire who walked to Edinburgh with his savings sewn into his coat to train as a doctor and eventually became a noted tutor at Cambridge, studying the orbit of the moon and correcting calculations of the distance of the earth from the sun. Mathematics, Dawson showed, could describe the world and open new vistas. <br>Both John and James Losh went on to Cambridge. James took his degree in 1786, the year of Sarah&#x2019;s birth. He began, as planned, by studying for the church but at Cambridge he became an admirer of Joseph Priestley, a Unitarian and avowed republican; no longer eligible for the church, he enrolled at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn and was called to the Bar. His home, though, was still Woodside, and in his twenties, when Sarah and Katharine were girls, he cut a striking Rousseau-esque figure, distinctly at odds with the farmers around him, elegantly dressed, his dark, shining hair hanging over his shoulders. George and William went to school briefly at Hawkshead, where William lodged with Anne Tyson at the same time as William Wordsworth and his younger brothers John and Christopher, and the Spedding brothers.7 George, always confrontational or &#x2018;disputacious&#x2019; as James called him, was destined for commerce and studied in France and Germany, while William went to college in Erfurt in the centre of Germany, where he met and became a lifelong friend of the great naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. The two brothers spent time in Sweden, a centre of new discoveries in chemistry and, with Russia, one of Newcastle&#x2019;s great trading partners for timber, tar and bar-iron. George also went to Russia, astounding the locals by walking out without a topcoat, and both brothers travelled to Italy, perhaps taking their sister Margaret with them.8 <br>George Losh, looking fine in his green silk waistcoat &#x2013; the only known portrait of any of the four surviving Losh brothers as dashing young men. <br>Sarah&#x2019;s father, John, was carefree, &#x2018;handsome in person, and highly generous, fond of the beautiful in woman as well as art and nature&#x2019;, as Henry Lonsdale tactfully put it.9 A gregarious soul, he was &#x2018;studious to please everybody, and as ready to entertain a peasant as a peer&nbsp;&#x2026; cock of the walk, and one of the most popular of men&#x2019;. In the girls&#x2019; childhood he was seen at all county gatherings, riding a black mare as highly strung as his father&#x2019;s, and was known for his love of country sports, following the hounds, wrestling and cock-fighting. Her mother, Isabella, was ten years his junior, only eighteen when they married. Small and elegant, with a classical profile, she was easy-going, affectionate and impulsive, fiercely defensive of her family, her husband and her children. She was not a local girl but came from Callerton Hall, near Newcastle. Her family, like the Loshes, cherished their history and stuck to their radical principles: one forebear, Thomas Bonner, had held out as a Puritan mayor in royalist Newcastle in 1649, and Cromwell, who was deeply unpopular in the region, was reputed to have hidden in the Hall. By contrast, when Isabella&#x2019;s brother, Robert Bonner, inherited his uncle&#x2019;s estate of Warwick Hall, east of Carlisle, and changed his name to Warwick in 1792, he moved into a devoutly Catholic enclave. The Warwicks were Catholics and Jacobites, like their neighbours, the Howards of Corby Castle: if Cromwell stayed at Callerton, Bonnie Prince Charlie slept at Warwick Hall. Woodside itself was the birthplace of Christopher Robinson, a Catholic priest who preached in defiance of the laws of Elizabeth I and was hanged, drawn and quartered in Carlisle in 1597. Tolerance and religious liberty, Sarah came to believe, were the only ways forward. <br>The Losh babie...</p><h2>For God, Country and Coca-Cola: The Unauthorized History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It</h2><p>Uncovering family tensions and questionable business tactics, this unauthorized history investigates a cornerstone of American corporations, tracing the evolution of Coca-Cola from its quiet beginnings, through its period of incredible growth, to the influential giant of today.</p><p>While the subtitle of Pendergrast's study suggests an ambush of Coca-Cola, the author obviously received at least semiofficial assistance in compiling his gossipy, essentially sympathetic history of a company that has attained cultural as well as commercial success. In a saga notable for vivid anecdotal detail, journalist Pendergrast toes the chronological line and appears more interested in telling lively tales than in providing a standard reference on the colossus of the soft-drink trade. The vastly entertaining, if episodic, narrative gets down to business with the story of Asa Candler, the Atlanta-based pharmacist who acquired rights to a patent medicine hawked as Pemberton's Tonic, renamed it Coca-Cola, and launched what became a multinational enterprise. The founding father's heirs sold out to Robert Woodruff in 1919; during his long tenure, the new patriarch single-mindedly focused on making the brand as familiar a symbol of America around the world as the stars and stripes. For over 90 of its 100-odd years, however, Coke has vied with upstart Pepsi for dominion in consumer outlets. Stung by the latter's steady inroads and cheeky ad campaigns, the young executives who took control of Coca-Cola during the 1980's ordered a change in the legendary formula. The public and press reacted furiously to any tampering with the flavor of the iconlike beverage, forcing the company to beat a hasty retreat. As Pendergrast makes clear, Coke has since recovered from this blunder and--despite ongoing problems with environmentalists, human-rights activists, and allied critics--has continued to expand its extraordinary franchise. A chatty, scrupulously documented account of a corporate phenomenon (and far more revealing than Elizabeth Candler Graham's The Real Ones, 1992) that's a bit like Coke itself: zesty and transiently refreshing. (Eight pages of photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Coca-Cola is one of the most celebrated products of this century. The trials and successes of Coke and its manufacturer, ranging from its invention to the wars with Pepsi, unfold in a historical narrative that keeps the reader focused and interested. Pendergrast, a business journalist, displays an impressive array of research from several collections and interviews with former company employees. The premise that Coca-Cola has religious undertones is somewhat far-fetched, but the author does an able job of proving that Coke is an American phenomenon. The last chapter, however, would have benefited from editing to make the transition from third to first person flow more smoothly. Recommended for general collections.<br><i>- Rebecca A.

Suddenly, Sherman finds himself embroiled in the most brutal, high-profile case of the year, as prosecutors, politicians, the press, the police, the clergy, and assorted hustlers rush in to further their own political and social agendas. With so many egos at stake, the last priority on anyone's mind is truth or justice, in this bitingly hilarious American satire.</p><p>After Tom Wolfe defined the '60s in <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> and <i>Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers</i> and the cultural U-turn at the turn of the '80s in <i>The Right Stuff</i>, nobody thought he could ever top himself again. In 1987, when <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i> arrived, the literati called Wolfe an "aging enfant terrible."<p> He wasn't aging; he was growing up. <i>Bonfire</i>'s pyrotechnic satire of 1980s New York wasn't just Wolfe's best book, it was the best bestselling fiction debut of the decade, a miraculously realistic study of an unbelievably status-mad society, from the fiery combatants of the South Bronx to the bubbling scum at the top of Wall Street. Sherman McCoy, a farcically arrogant investment banker (dubbed a "Master of the Universe," Wolfe's brilliant metaphorical co-opting of a then-important toy for boys), hits a black guy in the Bronx with his Mercedes and runs--right into a nightmare peopled by vicious mistresses, thin wives like "social x-rays," slime-bag politicos, tabloid hacks, and Dantesque denizens of the "justice" system. If the Coen and Marx brothers together dramatized <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, Wolfe's <i>Bonfire</i> would probably be funnier. Many think his second novel, <i>A Man in Full</i>, is deeper, but <i>Bonfire</i> will never die down.</p><p> You might find it interesting to compare the film <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, a fascinating calamity perpetrated by the geniuses Brian De Palma and Tom Hanks, with <i>The Right Stuff</i>, one of the very best films of the '80s. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"A big, bitter, funny, craftily plotted book that grabs you by the lapels and won't let go."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"It's the human comedy, on a skyscraper scale and at a taxi-meter pace . . . .

Each had to look beyond the battlefield to decide whom to fight, when, and why; to know what victory was and when to end the war; to determine how to bring stability to the lands he conquered. Each general had to be a battlefield tactician and more: a statesman, a strategist, a leader. <br><br>Tactics change, weapons change, but war itself remains much the same throughout the centuries, and a great warrior must know how to define success. Understanding where each of these three great (but flawed) commanders succeeded and failed can serve anyone who wants to think strategically or has to demonstrate leadership. In <i>Masters of Command, </i>Barry Strauss explains the qualities these great generals shared, the keys to their success, from ambition and judgment to leadership itself. <br><br>The result of years of research, <i>Masters of Command </i>is based on surviving written documents and archeological evidence as well as the author&#x2019;s travels in Italy, France, Greece, Turkey, and Tunisia in the footsteps of Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar.</p><p><b>Barry Strauss</b>, professor of history and classics at Cornell University, is a leading expert on ancient military history.

Is the human body designed to eat plant foods, animal foods, or both? Respectively, are we herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores? </p><p> While the human gastrointestinal tract is capable of digesting both plant and animal foods, there are indications that we evolved to digest primarily plant foods. Specifically, our teeth are composed of twenty molars, which are perfect for crushing and grinding plant foods, along with eight front incisors, which are well suited for biting into fruits and vegetables. Only our front four canine teeth are designed for meat eating, and our jaws swing both vertically to tear and laterally to crush, while carnivores' jaws swing only vertically. Additional evidence that supports the human body's preference for plant foods is the long length of the human intestinal tract. Carnivores typically have a short bowel, while herbivores have a bowel length proportionally comparable to humans'. </p><p> To answer the question of what humans should eat, many researchers look to other primates, such as chimpanzees, monkeys, and gorillas. These nonhuman wild primates are omnivores. They are also often described as herbivores and opportunistic carnivores in that although they eat mainly fruits and vegetables, they may also eat small animals, lizards, and eggs if given the opportunity. For example, the gorilla and the orangutan eat only 1 percent and 2 percent of animal foods as a percentage of total calories, respectively. The remainder of their diet is derived from plant foods. Since humans are between the weight of the gorilla and orangutan, it has been suggested that humans are designed to eat around 1.5 percent of their diet in the form of animal foods. However, most Americans derive well over 50 percent of their calories from animal foods. </p><p> Since wild primates fill up on wild fruit and other highly nutritious plant foods, those weighing one tenth the amount of a typical human ingest nearly ten times the level of vitamin C and much higher amounts of many other vitamins and minerals (see Table 1.1). How is this possible? One reason is that the cultivated fruit in an American supermarket is far different from the wild fruit of the primate's diet, having a slightly higher protein content and a higher content of certain essential vitamins and minerals. Cultivated fruit tends to be higher in sugars and, while very tasty to humans, it is not nearly as nutritious. In fact, it raises blood sugar levels much more quickly than its wild counterparts do. </p><p> There are other differences in the wild primate diet that are also important to highlight, such as a higher ratio of alpha-linolenic acid -- the essential omega-3 fatty acid -- to linoleic acid -- the essential omega-6 fatty acid. A higher ratio of omega-3 fatty acid decreases the likelihood of the development of inflammatory and chronic diseases as well as their severity. Finally, the wild primate diet is very high in fiber, while the average American diet is not. A high-fiber diet protects against heart disease and many types of cancer. </p><p> Determining what diet humans are best suited for may not be as simple as looking at the diet of wild primates. Humans have some significant structural and physiological differences compared to apes. The key difference may be our larger, more metabolically active brains. In fact, it has been theorized that a shift in dietary intake to more animal foods may have produced the stimulus for human brain growth. The shift itself was probably the result of limited food availability, which forced early humans to hunt grazing mammals such as antelope and gazelle. Archaeological data support this association -- humans' brains started to grow and become more developed at about the same time evidence shows an increase of animal bones being butchered with stone tools at early villages. </p><p> While improved dietary quality alone cannot fully explain why human brains grew, it definitely appears to have played a critical role. With their bigger brains, early humans were able to engage in more complex social behavior, which led to improved foraging and hunting tactics, which, in turn, led to even higher quality food intake that fostered additional brain evolution. </p><p> Data from anthropologists looking at evidence from hunter-gatherer cultures is providing much insight as to what humans are designed to eat. However, it is important to point out that these cultures were not entirely free to determine their diets. Instead, their diets were molded as a result of what was available to them. For example, the diet of the Inuit Eskimos is far different from that of the Australian Aborigines. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to answer the question "What should humans eat?" simply by looking at these studies alone. </p><p> Nonetheless, regardless of whether a hunter-gatherer community relied on animal or plant foods, the rate of diseases of civilization such as heart disease and cancers was extremely low. </p><p> How is this possible? One reason is that the meat our ancestors consumed was much different from the meat we find in the supermarket today. Domesticated animals have always had higher fat levels than their wild counterparts, but the desire for tender meat has driven the fat content of domesticated animals to 25 to 30 percent or higher compared to a fat content of less than 4 percent for free-living animals or wild game. In addition, the type of fat is considerably different. Domestic beef contains primarily saturated fats and virtually undetectable amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. In contrast, the fat of wild animals contains over five times more polyunsaturated fat per gram and has desirable amounts of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids (approximately 4 percent). </p><p> What conclusions can we draw from the evidence of the wild primate and hunter-gatherer diets about how we should eat today? Overwhelmingly, it appears that humans are better suited to a diet composed primarily of plant foods. This position is supported also by a tremendous amount of evidence showing that deviating from a predominantly plant-based diet is a major factor in the development of heart disease, cancer, strokes, arthritis, and many other chronic degenerative diseases. It is now the recommendation of many health and medical organizations that the human diet should focus primarily on plant-based foods, comprising vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. </p><p> The evidence supporting diet's role in chronic degenerative diseases is substantial. There are two basic facts linking the diet-disease connection: </p><p> 1. A diet rich in plant foods is protective against many diseases that are extremely common in Western society. </p><p> 2. A diet providing a low intake of plant foods is a causative factor in the development of these diseases and provides conditions under which other causative factors became more active. </p><p> <b>The Pioneering Work of Denis Burkitt and Hugh Trowell</b> </p><p> Much of the link between diet and chronic disease originated from the work of two medical pioneers: Denis Burkitt, M.D., and Hugh Trowell, M.D., editors of Western Diseases: Their Emergence and Prevention, first published in 1981. Although now extremely well recognized, the work of Burkitt and Trowell is actually a continuation of the landmark work of Weston A. Price, a dentist and author of Nutrition and Physical Degeneration. In the early 1900s, Dr. Price traveled the world observing changes in teeth and palate (orthodontic) structure as various cultures discarded traditional dietary practices in favor of a more "civilized" diet. Price was able to follow individuals as well as cultures over periods of twenty to forty years, and he carefully documented the onset of degenerative diseases as their diets changed. </p><p> Based on the extensive studies examining the rate of diseases in various populations (epidemiological data), including the groundbreaking work of Dr. Price and their own observations of primitive cultures, Burkitt and Trowell formulated the following sequence of events: </p><p> <b>First stage:</b> In cultures consuming a traditional diet consisting of whole, unprocessed foods, the rate of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer is quite low. </p><p> <b>Second stage:</b> Commencing with eating a more "Western" diet, there is a sharp rise in the number of individuals with obesity and diabetes. </p><p> <b>Third stage:</b> As more and more people abandon their traditional diet, conditions that were once quite rare become extremely common. </p><p> Examples of these conditions include constipation, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and appendicitis. </p><p> <b>Fourth stage:</b> Finally, with full Westernization of the diet, other chronic degenerative or potentially lethal diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout, become extremely common. </p><p> Since the publication in Western Diseases of Burkitt and Trowell's pioneering research, a virtual landslide of data has continually verified the role of the Western diet as the key factor in virtually every chronic disease, but especially in obesity and diabetes. In 1984, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council established the Committee on Diet and Health to undertake a comprehensive analysis on diet and major chronic diseases. Their findings, as well as those of the U.S. surgeon general, the National Cancer Institute, and other highly respected medical groups brought to the forefront the need for Americans to change their eating habits to reduce their risk for chronic disease. Table 1.2 lists diseases with convincing links to a diet low in plant foods. Many of these now-common diseases were extremely rare before the twentieth century. </p><p> <b>Trends in U.S. Food Consumption</b> </p><p> During the twentieth century, food consumption patterns changed dramatically. Total dietary fat intake increased from 32 percent of calories in 1909 to 43 percent by the end of the century; carbohydrate intake dropped from 57 ...</p></p><h2>Sweet Revenge (Goldy Culinary Mystery, Book 14)</h2><p><p>Goldy Schulz is thrilled to be catering a holiday breakfast feast for the staff of the Aspen Meadow Library.

Kenneth Johnson holds a degree in Religious Studies from California State University Fullerton. His emphasis was in the study of mythology and this interest is reflected in his writing and his astrological practice. Kenneth discovered astrology while traveling in Europe during the summer of 1973. He studied in Amsterdam and London before returning to the United States and developing a practice which focuses on archetypal themes and personal mythologies. In addition to his astrological interests, Kenneth is also a musical theater librettist and a member of the Dramatists Guild. ~<b>Part I <br>Astrology, Psychology, and Myth <br>Chapter 1 <br>Astrology and the Gods <br></b>Anyone who has ever delved into the art of astrology, whether deeply or not, has heard phrases like &#x201c;Mars in Capricorn&#x201d; or &#x201c;Jupiter in the Fourth House.&#x201d; This might give you the impression that the planets, like Mars and Jupiter, are characters in a drama, and that when we speak of them as being in &#x201c;Capricorn&#x201d; or &#x201c;the Fourth House&#x201d; or wherever, it is just as if we were to say &#x201c;Joan is in Pennsylvania&#x201d; or &#x201c;Derek is at his brother&#x2019;s house.&#x201d; <br>In fact, this impression is correct. The planets are characters or actors in a <br>drama, and the drama is you&#x2015;your life, your consciousness, your spirit. As <br>part of your life drama, they may choose to occupy a certain sign or a certain house, but it is the planets themselves who are the actors, the personalities. <br> <br>But who are they, really? All we have to do is consider their names, and the <br>answer suggests itself very easily: they are the goddesses and gods of ancient Greek and Roman mythology. Jupiter, for example, is the planet of abundance, just as Jupiter or Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods, was a &#x201c;giver of gifts.&#x201d; Venus is the planet of love, and of course the goddess Venus or Aphrodite was the ancient goddess of love and desire. But this is to state the case in a very basic, even simplistic way. <br> <br>The goddesses and gods who gave their names to the astrological planets <br>have a long ancestry&#x2015;and it doesn&#x2019;t actually begin in Greece itself. There is a common misconception among casual observers of history that the framework of our Western world was entirely originated by the Greeks. But the Greeks did not invent the planetary deities; the mythic background of astrology came originally from Sumer and Babylon. <br> <br>During the past century, whole libraries from ancient Sumer and Babylon <br>have been uncovered. Stacks and stacks of cuneiform tablets have been translated by scholars. Thousands of inscriptions record the omen literature of the era. Esoteric writings, ritual texts, lamentations, medical recipes, dream books, texts to counter witchcraft, lists of auspicious days, and so on fill these ancient tablets. <br> <br>Anu was the god of heaven.His son Enlil was the god of earth. These were <br>not separate domains, but instead two parts of the same domain. Earth was <br>not lesser than heaven. There was an interdependence and complementary <br>relationship between the two, and the omens or messages could clearly be <br>seen as coming from one or the other realm. From them and their interplay, <br>the West has inherited much of the body of its astrological mythology&#x2015;the <br>names and details changing but the stories remaining relatively similar. <br>Though many may speculate that astrology is much older, the first written <br>proof of its usage dates from the seventh century BCE and was found in King Ashurbanipal&#x2019;s library in Assyria. Here we find predictions that dealt with matters affecting the entire country and its rulers, such as war and peace, plagues and famines, floods and droughts, etc. The world&#x2019;s oldest astrology book, the <i>Enuma Anu Enlil, </i>was the chief &nbsp;atrological/astronomical text of the time. Astrological divination was its chief concern. The kings of ancient Babylon required two things from their astrologers. First, it was necessary to predict, with some precision, the occurrence of eclipses. Second, the moment the moon appeared as a crescent sliver each month in the night sky was extremely important, because it was at this moment that the Babylonian calendar month began.1 From the actual observable appearance in the sky of moons, <br>eclipses, stars, and planets, stories began to unfold. It was not enough simply to observe a crescent moon in Taurus; the stars that the two horns of the moon pointed to were equally important. And if the moon contained a halo, that was another omen. <br> <br>The planets as we know them today originated as the goddesses and gods <br>of Sumer and Babylon. Matched with their Greek counterparts and given <br>Greek and Latin names, they remain with us even today. Many&#x2015;perhaps <br>most&#x2015;of them bore names that have become distant and unfamiliar to us. <br>There was Anu the supreme sky god, his sons Enlil and Enki (who were sworn rivals), and then Ninhursag,Marduk, Ishkur, Nannar, Ninurta, Inanna, Nabu, Utu, and Nergal. Some of the members of this divine family got along great together; others absolutely hated each other. Sound familiar? We might recognize these deities as having some similarities both in character and function to the later twelve Olympians of the Greek system. The important point here, however, is that as astrology developed in the observatories of ancient Babylon, it was these early deities for whom the planets were named, and who were recognized as having a nature and function similar to the planet with which they were linked.2 <br> <br><b>Babylonian Deity Planet <br></b>Sin The Moon <br>Shamash The Sun <br>Ishtar Venus <br>Ninurta Saturn <br>Nergal Mars <br>Marduk Jupiter <br>Nabu Mercury <br>Mesopotamian astrology was concerned primarily with politics, matters of <br>state, and the fortunes of kings. It was not especially concerned with ordinary individuals and their daily problems. There is no evidence that personal horoscopes were calculated much before about 409 BC. In fact, it was the astrologers of Greek-speaking Egypt who, in the first centuries before the Christian era, transformed Babylonian astrology into the personal and individuated art form that it is today. In these same centuries, Babylonian astrology also traveled to Persia and India, where it influenced older forms of indigenous astrology. The astrologers of this &#x201c;classical&#x201d; period were still focused upon the observable sky, and they evolved interpretive tools that made use of their observations.Some of these tools have, unfortunately, been forgotten. One of the most important was called planetary <i>sect</i>. Sect was determined simply by whether one was born during the daylight hours when the sun ruled the sky, or at night when the lunar force was dominant.3 Planets were linked with the Sun and Moon, Sol and Luna, according to their nature. There were variations upon the <br>central theme. For example, one could be born at night, under Luna&#x2019;s power, even when Luna was not visible. (For this to occur, the Moon would have to be in its dark phase, very close to the Sun.) And for those instances when the Sun was right on the local horizon, just rising or setting, one had to be there to determine its true position. <br> <br>There are very few civilizations upon this planet that did not deem astrology <br>essential to its very existence all the way back through recorded history. <br>Astrologers have always been priests and priestesses who kept the myths and traditions of their people. <br> <br>The Greeks did not invent the planetary goddesses and gods. All the same, <br>it is Greek mythology that forms the most important foundation for the planetary archetypes of Western astrology. Not only is it at the foundation of Western civilization itself, Greek myth constitutes a highly sophisticated and poetically detailed worldview that has sustained, entertained, educated, and informed our thinking for the past 3,500 years. The Greek poets were master storytellers. There&#x2019;s probably still not a book in print that can surpass the tales told by Homer in <i>The Iliad </i>and <i>The Odyssey</i>, though if one were to curl up with Gilgamesh&#x2019;s heroic journeys and adventuresome tales for summer beach reading, one might find something just as exciting as any current bestseller. <br> <br>Gilgamesh, for those who haven&#x2019;t met the gentleman, is the hero of a <br>Babylonian poem bearing the same name&#x2015;a very old story indeed, for it has its roots in ancient Sumer.4 Here, already, we find some of the planetary <br>deities&#x2015;notably Ishtar&#x2015;storming across the page. Here we find the symbolism of the four fixed signs of the zodiac already fully developed as Ishtar&#x2019;s lion (Leo), her bull (Taurus), the scorpion men who guard the mountain passes to the Otherworld (Scorpio), and the fabulous Utnapishtim, Keeper of the Waters of Life (Aquarius) and survivor of a Great Flood much older than the one in the Bible. Though Gilgamesh&#x2019;s tales were told 6,000 years ago, a good Hollywood screenwriter could no doubt turn it into an epic blockbuster (for a few hundred million dollars). <br> <br>But despite astrology&#x2019;s Mesopotamian origins and Greek florescence, the <br>names we give to the planets today are Latin. The Romans had their own <br>tribal myths that greatly resembled those of Greece (and in fact the two cultures are linguistically related), but tended to adopt the Greek versions of the stories in their entirety after Greece was conquered by Rome. They tampered but little with the images and symbolism that the Greeks wrote, sung, talked about, and painted on thousands of temple walls, frescoes, friezes, and vases. <br> <br>They just changed the names&#x2015;Greek Zeus was now Roman Jupiter; Greek <br>Aphrodite was now Roman Venus. And that&#x2019;s where our planetary names <br>originate&#x2015;imported from Mount Olympus by way of Rome. (The following <br>list includes asteroids and contemporary astrological factors as well as the traditional ones.) <br> <br><b>Greek Roman <br></b>Apollo Sun (Sol) <br>Artemis Moon (Luna) <br>Gaia Earth (Terra) <br>Hermes Mercury <br>Aphrodite Venus <br>Ares Mars <br>Zeus Jupiter (Jove) <br>Cronus Saturn <br>Ouranos Uranus <br>Poseidon Neptune <br>Hades Pluto <br>Demeter Ceres <br>Athene Pallas <br>Hera Juno <br>Hestia Vesta <br> <br>The appropriation of one culture&#x2019;s religion by another is something that is oft <br>repeated in almost every civilization.When one civilization overtakes another, whether by conquest or cultural absorption, it sometimes seeks to eradicate the other culture&#x2019;s religion entirely. There are countless examples all over the world: Greek temples built upon the sites of former Goddess shrines, Christian cathedrals built over Pagan worship sites, Spanish missions built next to an Indian pueblo&#x2019;s sacred kivas, and the like. <br>And yet one civilization often adopts the other&#x2019;s gods peacefully, though <br>usually with significant changes. In many cases this is a true integration of <br>religious traditions between the conqueror and the conquered. In ancient Ireland, the deities of the Indo-European Celtic tribes were clearly merged with and influenced by the older religion of the megalith builders. In Brazil, the gods of the African slaves have impacted and influenced the religious attitude of the entire culture.We may be seeing another such phenomenon in America today, as the Japan it conquered during World War II continues to influence Americans through its religious traditions such as Zen and other Buddhist or Taoist traditions that the Japanese themselves had inherited from the older civilization of China. <br> <br>In the case of Greece and Rome, the adoption of Greek deities by the <br>Romans was more than peaceful&#x2015;the Romans were eager to experience the more sophisticated culture of conquered Greece, and eagerly embraced her gods. And because Western civilization as a whole derives directly from the break-up of the old Roman Empire, the deities of the Greeks have become the common inheritance of our entire civilization, something all of us hold in common in the deepest recesses of the soul. <br> <br>By the twentieth century, astrology had all but been removed from the sky. <br>On the one hand, precision of mathematical calculations made the calculation of planetary motion much easier for astrologers, first with astrolabes, then with calculators, and finally with computers. But at what price? In a sense, we have lost the real feeling and imagery of what the sky looks like at the magical moment of creation or birth, with their accompanying stories. <br> <br>Next time you&#x2019;re in the desert, under a clear night sky, you might notice that <br>a luminescent Venus is setting in the western sky while a brilliant Jupiter <br>might be rising in the east through the horns of the bull. Further, a two-thirds <br>full moon is up overhead. That is the way to the magic of the birth moment. <br>Nothing else shows this magic of existence with the crystal clarity of <br>astrology. <br> <br>Astrology As A Mythic Language <br> <br>It is the premise of our earlier book, <i>Mythic Astrology: Archetypal Powers in the Horoscope</i>, that the identification between planets and ancient deities is more than just a vague, generalized kind of identification&#x2015;it is specific and deep, and it opens windows of understanding upon the planets that cannot be opened in any other way.5 These windows of understanding are important because they help to make it clear that astrology is indeed a mythic language. <br> <br>But what do we mean by the term <i>mythic language? </i>Many people are <br>accustomed to thinking of the word &#x201c;myth&#x201d; as referring to a mere fairy tale or, at worst, a fabrication, an &#x201c;untrue story.&#x201d; But this is to misunderstand the very nature of mythology itself. The stories we call myths are, in fact, the wisdom tales and spiritual truths of ancient religions, the religions of our own ancestors as well as of people in widely scattered regions of the globe. As such, myths convey to us, in story form, the deepest and most profound truths of the human psyche, and of our shared human experience. This is why it is important to understand that astrology is a mythic language, and that it contains the same universal truths about the human soul that are to be found in all the world&#x2019;s great mythologies. <br> <br>It is even more important because of the simple fact that most of us are no <br>longer aware of the rich, profound world of myth. The Western world has <br>been progressively turning away from myth ever since the advent of Christianity, and the so-called &#x201c;scientific revolution&#x201d; of the past 200 years has very nearly destroyed our mythic sensibilities altogether. Astrology is one of the few remaining ways in which we still touch the mythic dimension of life. Through astrology, people living in urban apartment buildings, rural farmsteads, or middle-American trailer parks know that Jupiter is the planet of abundance and Venus the planet of love. They may not know that Jupiter&#x2019;s abundant nature reflects his status as &#x201c;king of the gods&#x201d; and they may not know the lore and legends surrounding the goddess Aphrodite, whose myths provide us with the inner meaning of the planet Venus. But because of astrology, they too are speaking a mythic language. <br> <br>Psychology And Myth <br> <br>For centuries, then, astrology was the last remaining &#x201c;mythic language&#x201d; to be widely known and practiced in the Western world. But in recent years, psychology has also discovered the world of myth.It began with Carl Jung. One of the founders of psychology, Jung broke with his mentor, Sigmund Freud, in 1912. The two great thinkers had reached a point of fundamental disagreement about the nature of the human psyche. <br> <br>Freud saw the unconscious minds of human beings as a chaotic and dark <br>receptacle of primitive sexual urges; and, as a scientist, he took a dim view of all religious and psychic phenomena, preferring to see these elements of <br>human nature simply as another aspect of sex, neurosis, and repression. <br>Jung, on the other hand, believed that the un...</p><h2>Unbounded Practice: Women and Landscape Architecture in the Early Twentieth Century</h2><p><p>Women have practiced as landscape architects for over a century, since the founding of the practice as a profession in the United States in the 1890s. They came to landscape architecture as gardeners, garden designers, horticulturalists, and fine artists. They simultaneously shaped the profession while reflecting contemporary practice. It is all the more surprising, then, that the history of women in American landscape design has received relatively little attention. Tha�sa Way corrects this oversight in <i>Unbounded Practice: Women and Landscape Architecture in the Early Twentieth Century. </i>Describing design practice in landscape architecture during the first half of the twentieth century, the book serves as a narrative both of women&#x2015;such as Beatrix Jones Farrand, Marian Cruger Coffin, Annette Hoyt Flanders, Ellen Biddle Shipman, Martha Brookes Hutcheson, and Marjorie Sewell Cautley&#x2015;and of the practice as it became a profession.</p><p>Winner of a 2008 David R. Coffin Publication Grant, awarded by the Foundation for Landscape Studies</p></p><p><p>Tha�sa Way is Assistant Professor in the College of Built Environments at the University of Washington.</p><p> <i>Unbounded Practice</i> will transform the accepted history of American landscape architecture as a narrative of successive male designers making autonomous design innovations. Tha�sa Way provides a nuanced account of the diverse ways in which women entered and succeeded in landscape architecture praxis.

His restrained limestone palaces and townhouses for the super rich defined a new elegance in American cities and seaside resorts.<br>A publicity-shy Philadelphian without social connections and only 10th grade education, Trumbauer opened his own practice, at the age of 21. Within just a few years he was on his way to becoming a leading practitioner of residential design on the grandest scale. No American builder in the first three decades of the 20th century could equal Trumbauer s output in the sheer number and splendor of his commissions. His large mansions were typically designed in English or French taste, and whether they were in the Whitemarsh Valley outside Philadelphia or new the ocean in Newport, Rhode Island, Trumbauer s houses had the imposing aristocratic demeanor his clients sought. <br>Michael Kathrens classic volume, originally published in 2002, remains the only work on this great American architect. The revised edition of American Splendor, featuring three additional chapters and 50 new color photographs, is due in stores in December 2011.</p><p>Michael Kathrens is an independent scholar specializing in American residential architecture and<br>interior decoration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The binding is sturdy and the pages are like new clean. The cover has slight soiling which can be cleaned.</p><p>Roger Tory Peterson has been regarded as America&#39;s most notable ornithologist following the publication of A Field Guide to the Birds in 1934. Like Audubon, Peterson received many honorary degrees and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Honor. Virginia Marie Peterson is a scientist and an expert on the environmental effects of oil spills.In the review of the original volume, LJ 's reviewer called this "the finest edition since the original double-elephant folio" and recommended its purchase by "all but the smallest libraries" ( LJ 1/1/82). Since then, no other edition has appeared to alter those judgments. The revisions in this new version are minor: the text has been somewhat rewritten, mainly to reflect recent changes in bird names and classification, and some of the double-page plates of the original have been reduced to one page. At the price, libraries owning the original do not need to acquire this book, but libraries that missed the first edition will wish to consider this one--if budgets permit.<br><i>- Paul B.

His engagement with disco nightlife continued throughout the decade as he wrote his weekly column for <i>Record World</i> magazine, which incorporated top ten playlists from DJs across the US (such as Larry Levan, Larry Sanders, Walter Gibbons, Tee Scott and Nicky Siano) alongside Aletti's own writings and interviews.</p><p>As disco grew from an underground secret to a billion-dollar industry, Aletti was there to document it, and <i>The Disco Files</i> is his personal memoir of those days, containing everything he wrote on the subject (most of it between 1974 and1978) augmented with photography by Peter Hujar and Toby Old. This book is the definitive and essential chronicle of disco, true from-the-trenches reporting that details, week by week, the evolution of the clubs, the DJs, and above all, the music, through magazine articles, beautiful photographs, hundreds of club charts and thousands of record reviews.</p><p>Photocopies of Aletti's <i>Record World</i> columns circulated for years among DJs and music lovers, until they were finally collected in 2009 into the first edition of <i>The Disco Files</i>, an instant classic that quickly sold out. This new edition of <i>The Disco Files</i> brings Aletti's compulsively readable disco writing back into print, adding an interview with Fran Lebowitz originally published in the <i>Village Voice</i> in 1990.</p><p>Throughout his career, curator, writer and critic Vince Aletti (born 1945) has been at the forefront of music, culture and the arts. He wrote for <i>Record World</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i> and covered the club scene in the late 1970s and 1980s for the <i>Village Voice</i>, where he would serve as art editor until 2005. In addition to curating numerous photography exhibitions, Aletti writes about photography for the <i>New Yorker</i>.</p></p><p>Aletti&#x2019;s book offers a different version of the disco experience, one that is premised not on mythically great nights out but on conversation and careful study of one&#x2019;s record collection.

Using an approach that was both artistically and scientifically ambitious he recorded, in words and pictures, the traces of the traditional Indian way of life that was already beginning to die out. With tireless personal commitment Curtis visited American Indian tribes from the Mexican border to the Bering Straits, gaining their confidence by his patience and sensitivity. This, his photographic life&#39;s work, was printed in 20 volumes between 1907 and 1930 as The North American Indian. There were only 272 copies in total, so original copies are now extremely rare. This book gives lasting life to Curtis&#39;s great achievements by making the photographs available again.</p><p>Originally used to illustrate a 20-volume encyclopedia of Native American history and culture, these photographs from the first decades of the 20th century are a valuable document of history. From a striking 1905 portrait of Geronimo to the seal-hunting Eskimos of Nunivak Island, Edward S. Curtis&#39;s pictures reflect the diversity of cultures that existed among the various Indian tribes. Their quality is superb--Curtis used the then-state-of-the-art photogravure process to reproduce his images--and the 1906 critique from Theodore Roosevelt remains valid: &#34;In Mr. Curtis we have both an artist and a trained observer ... whose work has far more than mere accuracy, because it is truthful.&#34;The author: Hans Christian Adam (born 1948) works as a photographic consultant in Gottingen. He has published many articles and some books on photography, including TASCHEN&#39;s monograph on Karl Blossfeldt.</p><h2>Performing the Faith: Bonhoeffer and the Practice of Nonviolence</h2><p>September 11, Afghanistan, Iraq--more than ever, this is a time for the church to be taking up the question of what, as Christians, our response to violence should be. In Performing the Faith, Stanley Hauerwas revisits the familiar territory of political nonviolence through discussion of the writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer-Christian ethicist, theologian, and by some definitions, martyr. This book is an intriguing commentary on Bonhoeffer&#39;s bold claim that if our common life rests on lies and injustice, we cannot be a community of peace. Pastors, seminarians, and those interested in Christian ethics are among the many who will be interested in this new word from an unwavering, faithful voice.</p><p>Stanley Hauerwas is the Gilbert T. Rowe Professor of Theological Ethics at Duke University. His previous books include With the Grain of the Universe, A Better Hope, and The Peaceable Kingdom.''Folksy, eclectic, disarmingly humble, and astonishingly wide-ranging, Hauerwas offers us a provocative reading of Bonhoeffer that, not surprisingly, assimilates him closely to John Howard Yoder. At the same time, Hauerwas replies to recent criticisms of his work by Jeffrey Stout. Contending that truth depends on performance far more than on theory, Hauerwas steps forward as a pacifist gadfly for a more truly faithful church and a more recognizably democratic society.''<br>--George Hunsinger, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>''This book shows how lively and fecund Hauerwas's thought remains. A dazzling performance, capable of entertaining and instructing professional theologians as much as those who think the world might be a better place without theologians in it.''<br>--Paul J. Griffiths, University of Illinois at Chicago<br><br>''Stan Hauerwas has done it again! He is able skillfully to blend into his book the passion for truth and justice of two of his greatest influences, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and John Howard Yoder. He takes these heroic advocates for peace into his own present-day struggle for the soul of the American nation. Hauerwas, an admirable Christian pacifist himself, dares Christians to be the 'Jesus people' they claim to be and to follow Jesus into the gospel path of nonviolence.''<br>--Geffrey B. Kelly, author of <i>Liberating Faith: Bonhoeffer's Message for Today</i><br><br>''Never totally predictable. Always a fresh perspective. And yet once again in these essays--on narrative, politics, Bonhoeffer, and the church--we hear the engaging, discerning, and brilliant voice we have come to know as Stanley Hauerwas.''<br>--Mark Thiessen Nation, Eastern Mennonite Seminary<br><br>''Contending with and learning from the witness of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, whose life is often thought to provide a Christian alternative to pacifism, Hauerwas deepens the account of Christian nonviolence he has been articulating for decades. His theology is strengthened and clarified by his encounter with the exemplary figure of Bonhoeffer.''<br>--Alan Jacobs, Wheaton College<br><br>''Without loss of the provocative edge that has made him a vital and distinctive Christian voice, Hauerwas's <i>Performing the Faith</i> allows him to cast a retrospective eye on his work. At the same time, in a brilliant essay under the title of the book, he develops a profoundly important description of faithfulness.''<br>--Dennis O'Brien, University of Rochester --Wipf and Stock Publishers</p><h2>The Usborne Book of Famous Artists</h2><p>Looks at the life and work of some of the greatest artists in history, including Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Monet, and Picasso.</p><p></p><h2>Endgame: A Novel (Doom #4)</h2><p>They left behind everything that mattered to them-- friends, lovers, country-- to journey to the stars.

I knew she wanted to hear she had been right. Spitefully, I wanted to keep her waiting. Actually, my reluctance to speak was more out of my own pain. No matter how brave a face I put on, I was still disappointed.<br><br>"She's not coming," I said quickly, my eyes downcast. "She says the attorney general is having them over for dinner. I'm supposed to call her if you dare make plans to go with me to England."<br><br>"I should go just for that," Grandmother Hudson said like a petulant little girl. "Have you packed everything?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>She slid a long white envelope over the table to me.<br><br>"What's this?"<br><br>"Extra spending money. I don't expect my sister will buy you anything you need. It's a bank draft, so soon after you arrive, ask Leonora to direct you to her bank and have it deposited. You know, of course, all the money will be changed to English pounds?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"You'll have to learn the exchange rate so you understand what things will cost. Of course you'll speak the same language," she continued, "but there are many differences. My sister has become an Anglophile. She has an accent and all, although there were times even recently when I caught her sounding more like an American. It will take a little getting used to, but that will be part of the adventure." She paused, sat back and sighed. "I wish I was your age, going off somewhere. I feel like I've been chained to this chair and imprisoned by my own traitorous heart," she moaned.<br><br>"You've told me many times that you did a great deal of traveling and that you enjoy not having to drag off somewhere," I reminded her.<br><br>"Yes, we did travel quite often until Everett became ill." She paused, looking thoughtful for a moment and then smirked at me. "No one told you that you have to memorize every last word I utter in this house and then throw them back at me."<br><br>I laughed at her and she smiled, wagging her head. Then she grew serious again.<br><br>"I should tell you a little about my sister Leonora and her husband Richard," she said sitting forward. "You already know he is a barrister, and Leonora will be the first to tell you how important he is. They live in a fancy part of London, Holland Park. I've actually only been there twice, once for a visit and once...for a funeral."<br><br>"Funeral?"<br><br>"They lost their only child Heather. She was seven at the time."<br><br>"How horrible. How did she die?"<br><br>"She was born with a defective heart valve and corrective surgery didn't solve the problem. One morning, they found she'd died in her sleep. It was very sad."<br><br>"What did you tell your sister about me?" I asked.<br><br>"What everyone else believes. It's better for us to leave it that way. My sister isn't as liberal minded as I am. For now, she thinks you're going there to live and help with the domestic chores while you attend the drama school. Since they have a maid, a cook, a butler and a chauffeur, I'm sure there won't be all that much for you to do. She's certainly not going to give up her maid and assign her duties to you. Having a team of servants is too much of a status symbol to Leonora."<br><br>"I'm not afraid of hard work, Grandmother."<br><br>"I know." She smiled and then her face turned somber to add, "It's not the work that will be hard. However, I wouldn't have agreed to send you over if I didn't feel you would do well, Rain. Mr. MacWaine will take good care of you, and I do hope to get there myself someday soon, despite my oppressive physician."<br><br>I nodded. I really did hope she would.<br><br>Later in the day while I was writing a letter to Roy, I heard Victoria come into the house. I could always tell when it was Victoria. Her heels tapped down on the tile floor like tiny hammers when she walked. Her steps were deliberate, each one falling with a vengeance. I suppose I could say she didn't walk as much as she marched, her long legs striding forcefully as her bony shoulders turned.<br><br>I could hear her voice, barely muffled behind Grandmother Hudson's closed door.<br><br>"I just learned of the expense of this ridiculous trip to England you're sponsoring, Mother. On top of it all, you're sending her first class?"<br><br>"You always travel first class, Victoria," I heard Grandmother Hudson remind her.<br><br>"That's me. I'm your daughter. I run the affairs here. I should travel first class. That...girl is a family disgrace, someone to hide, not blatantly wave about as if we're all so proud my sister had an illegitimate child with a black man. Daddy would turn over in his grave. He didn't even travel first class!"<br><br>"Your father never took advantage of his money. I never understood the reason for making it if you don't enjoy it," Grandmother Hudson said calmly.<br><br>"Exactly my point. She didn't make it, did she?"<br><br>"When will you understand that what I do with my money is my business, Victoria? We've had this conversation ad nauseam. If you want to be thrifty, be so with your own money and leave me alone."<br><br>"I saw how much that school is costing, too," Victoria said, ignoring Grandmother Hudson's wishes. "It's ridiculous to assume she has any talent on the basis of a school play. Conor MacWaine is robbing us. He probably enjoys taking advantage of stupid Americans."<br><br>"Are you calling me stupid?"<br><br>"It's not very bright to spend forty thousand dollars on...on that girl becoming an actress."<br><br>"If you're quite finished..."<br><br>"I'm not finished. I want to know when you're calling your attorney about the will, Mother."<br><br>"I told you what I've done I will not undo. When you make up your own will, you can leave her out."<br><br>"What?" Victoria's laugh was more like a thin squeal. "You don't think I'll ever include her in my will, do you? Oh, what's the use? I'm wasting my breath."<br><br>"Finally, you say something intelligent."<br><br>"Everyone shouldn't depend on me keeping my mouth shut forever about this, Mother. One of these days..."<br><br>"You'll do nothing," Grandmother Hudson snapped. "If you so much as suggest..."<br><br>"It's not right and it's...unhealthy to be coddling her like this. Megan should be ashamed of what she has done to the rest of us."<br><br>It grew quiet and then a few moments later, Victoria emerged from the room and stomped out of the house. I hoped she had marched out of my life. She was so bitter, with her teeth clenched all the time and her eyebrows turned in like someone with a continuous headache. She seemed to take pleasure in nothing. I didn't think she even liked herself, much less me. I imagined she lived in a house without mirrors so she could avoid looking at herself.<br><br>When I saw Grandmother Hudson later in the day, I didn't mention hearing any of the conversation between her and Victoria. I was sure she wanted me to forget it as quickly as she apparently did. She enjoyed so little in the way of pleasure from her children and grandchildren. It made me reconsider what it means to be rich and to be poor.<br><br>Just as he had promised, Jake was there early the next morning. We had barely finished breakfast when he arrived. After he stepped into the dining room, I realized I rarely, if ever, had seen Jake in the house. Occasionally he would bring in groceries or whatever packages had to be carried, but usually he waited outside by the car. This morning he looked spiffy. His uniform was cleaned and pressed and the brim of his cap glittered in the light of the chandelier.<br><br>"Morning, ladies," he declared as he took a tiny bow. "I am here to fetch the princess and her things for her journey to the Old World."<br><br>"Don't make a fool of yourself this early in the morning, Jake Marvin," Grandmother Hudson warned. She glanced quickly at me and then straightened with a military posture in her chair. "Everything is waiting in her room."<br><br>"Thank you, ladies," he replied with a smile on his lips, pivoted and paraded off to get my luggage.<br><br>"I'll miss Jake," I said, looking after him with a soft smile on my face.<br><br>"Yes, well, when you get to London, you'll see the way a chauffeur is supposed to behave, I'm sure. My sister wears her servants like ribbons on her chest. They're all properly uniformed and trained. My brother-in-law runs his home as if it was a Swiss timepiece. They live their lives according to the tick of that grandfather's clock. The English and their high tea.<br><br>"When I think of what a dizzy, foolish little girl Leonora was before she went to finishing school and then to England, I marvel at what one's ego can accomplish," Grandmother Hudson said.<br><br>"Don't you like your sister?"<br><br>"Like her? Of course I don't like her. I love her as I should love a sister, but we never got along. Now that I think of it, your mother takes after Leonora more than she takes after me. Some gene must have jumped ship when I wasn't looking," she added.<br><br>"Are you sure your sister really wants me there?" I asked, still suspicious about everyone's motives.<br><br>"Leonora doesn't do anything she doesn't want to do, even though she owes me more than she can ever repay. I don't mean to make her seem unpleasant. I have no doubt you'll enjoy your stay there and she'll be able to brag about the great charitable thing she's doing, and for an American no less!"<br><br>We heard Jake carrying my bags down the stairs. Grandmother Hudson glanced at the small clock in her hutch and then looked at me.<br><br>"You should get yourself ready," she said in a softer voice.<br><br>My heart began to thump like a tire that had gone flat. I still couldn't believe I was going to be taken to the airport and flown across the ocean. Grandmother Hudson had seen to my passport. Everything had been done. There was nothing left to do but go. I stood up slowly.<br><br>"I'm not good at good-byes," she said, "but I'll walk out with you."<br><br>"I was hoping you would come along to the airport," I said.<br><br>"Oh, I hate that ride. Besides, you have to learn how to be on your own from the get-go," she added firmly.<br><br>I swallowed back my anxiety and started out. She was right behind me.<br><br>Jake stood by the Rolls holding the rear door open for me. His smile glimmered in the morning sunlight. I hesitated on the steps, took a deep breath and started toward the car. Grandmother Hudson followed. When I got to the car, I turned and we looked at each other. I had a sinking feeling in my chest. What if we never saw each other again? I had said good-bye to too many people this year, I thought.<br><br>"Are you going to take better care of yourself?" I asked her.<br><br>"Do I have a choice with all these doctors poking their noses in my business?"<br><br>"No," I replied.<br><br>"Then you've answered your own question. Stop worrying about me. I'm an old lady. Worry about yourself, about becoming someone of whom we would all be proud, including your mama," she added.<br><br>It brought a smile to my face.<br><br>"Thank you." I glanced at Jake. The way he looked at us made me wonder if he knew more than he pretended to know. Impulsively, I stepped forward and gave Grandmother Hudson a hug. She stiffened as if it was unwelcomed, but in her eyes I saw the softness and affection that had drawn me closer to her all these months.<br><br>"I was afraid there was nobody in my family with a sense of propriety and the grit to do the right things. Don't disappoint me," she said.<br><br>"I won't." I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes.<br><br>"Good-byes are simply ridiculous," she muttered, spun around and headed back into the house.<br><br>Jake winked at me.<br><br>I got into the vehicle and he closed the door. Grandmother Hudson paused at the front door and looked back. I rolled the window down and we just gazed at each other. Then I lifted my hand as Jake started the engine. I waved once. She waved back and we were on our way. She watched us leave and then turned and entered the house.<br><br>How lonely she was, I thought, despite her brave and blustery act. She should be the one who goes off to drama school, not me. She's a much better actress. Both her daughters were disappointing to her and she didn't enjoy her grandchildren. Her friends were all society ladies who used her for her charity contributions. Her house was full of echoes, empty voices, dark memories, heavy whispers and heavier music drifting out of windows and caught in the wind.<br><br>"Don't worry about our queen," Jake said. He had been watching me in the rearview mirror. "I'll see that she does the right things and gets over to see you in short order."<br><br>"You?" I started to laugh, but there was a look on Jake's face that told me not to underestimate him. "I hope so, Jake," I said.<br><br>As we rode to the airport, Jake told me stories of his own travels, filling them with little warnings about people, about scam artists.<br><br>"Be really careful about who you talk to and never show your money. Never show anyone where you're keeping it on you, Rain. Just take out a few bucks for gum and magazines and stash the rest safely, hear?"<br><br>"Yes, Jake."<br><br>"If you take your time and don't let anyone rush you along, you won't make mistakes. When you're in a strange place, it's always better to listen first and talk last."<br><br>"All right, Jake."<br><br>"Just go directly to your boarding gate and wait with your carry-on luggage right by you. If you leave it for a second, there'll be some creep ready to scoop it up. The airports are full of parasites who hang around just looking for someone like yourself who looks green."<br><br>"Me? Green?" I started to laugh, but Jake kept a serious expression.<br><br>"These people are experts, Rain.

When they lie beside them in winter there is no hope of telling them apart from the rocks themselves; indeed, they&#x2019;re far trickier than white foxes, which always cast a shadow or look yellow against the snow. <br>A blue vixen lies tight against her stone, letting the snow drift over her on the windward side. She turns her rump to the weather, curls up, and pokes her snout under her thigh, lowering her eyelids till there&#x2019;s the merest hint of a pupil. And so she keeps an eye on the man who has not shifted since he took cover under the overhanging drift, here on the upper slopes of Asheimar, some eighteen hours ago. The snow has drifted and fallen over him until he resembles nothing so much as a hump of ruined wall. <br>The creature must take care not to forget that the man is a hunter. <br>&nbsp; <br>He began his pursuit away south at Botn. The sky was clear and the first blush of day at its winter blackest. The man slid down over the home fields, then set a course north over the Asar to Litla-Bjarg, where it had not drifted as yet. <br>Once there, he caught a movement on the brow of the hill. Thrusting a hand inside his clothes, he took out a spyglass, extended it, and put it to his good eye: <br>Yes, there was no mistaking it! <br>There was a daughter of Reynard on the move. <br>&nbsp; <br>She seemed blithely unaware of any danger. All her movements indicated that she was on the prowl for a bite to eat. She went about her business unhurriedly, intent on this sole purpose. <br>The man took a closer look at her. <br>He bent his thought hard upon her, trying to get an inkling of what she intended, of which way she would go when she had finished her nosing on the crest. All of a sudden she took off at a run; the man couldn&#x2019;t imagine why. Her whole demeanor showed that she sensed a grave threat. Yet she couldn&#x2019;t have had the least suspicion of the man&#x2014;by ordinary means. <br>She must have had a foreboding of his intention: <br>He&#x2019;s a man with hunting on his mind. <br>&nbsp; <br>The man walked up the hill. He tried to keep the image of the vixen clear in his mind to help him find her again the more easily: &#x201c;She spins over the hard-packed snow like a top.&#x201d; <br>Up on the crest he cast around for the vixen&#x2019;s tracks. He pinched one fox print between thumb and forefinger; it seemed a sizable beast. In the snowflake that lingered on his fingertip lay a gleaming hair&#x2014;there was no mistaking the color: blue. <br>Vertical streaks of cloud in the west. <br>Maybe a storm on the way. <br>The vixen nowhere to be seen. <br>&nbsp; <br>The trail was plain, as far as the eye could see. <br>The man walked briskly with the wind at his back. It didn&#x2019;t much matter now if the vixen caught his scent; she knew he was after her. <br>He paused every now and then to cast around, using the same method as before. He bent all his thought on the one goal of working out which way the vixen would run and where he would get within striking distance. <br>All at once he receives word of which way she is going and where he will get within striking distance: <br>&#x201c;The vixen is going north over the plain. She&#x2019;ll double sharply to the east with the gravel beds of Melar before her, nothing but stones; a perfect hiding place for a blue fox.&#x201d; <br>Was she too intent to take care? Had she given all her mind over to the danger&#x2014;thereby letting him into her thoughts? Had she paid no heed to warding him off? <br>Had the man received a thought-message from the vixen? <br>&nbsp; <br>Out on the stony plain the air was still and freezing hard; only the lightest breath touched his cheek. The man saw a bluish bump far to the north. He held himself still. After a while the bump began to stir. And shortly afterward a blue vixen rose from the stones. <br>&#x201c;Ha, there she is!&#x201d; <br>A rare beast. Dark as earth to look at, with a thick pelt and bushy tail, clearly jumpy as hell. She sprang away in sharp, stiff bounds. <br>The man set off at a run. <br>As he had suspected, the vixen made straight for the blowing snow. In the very instant before the blizzard swallowed her, she stopped short and glanced back at the man. <br>Then whisked away again at a terrific pace. <br>&nbsp; <br>There was a whining in the air. <br>A ptarmigan hurtled past, a hairsbreadth from the man, driven before the wind. It was followed by a falcon, flying high with sure and steady wing beats. <br>The man turned away from the blast, tightened his scarf, and wrapped the shoulder strap three times around his right arm so the bag rested tight against his hip. <br>He was not too late for the storm. <br>&nbsp; <br>The man trudged through the impenetrable murk. <br>At first he had stony ground underfoot and the going was not too bad, but the snow soon thickened; conditions deteriorated. <br>He had to trust to his line of thought: <br>&#x201c;The vixen can be childishly weather-shy. She&#x2019;ll dig herself into a drift or press herself deep into crannies, well below the frost mark, and there she&#x2019;ll stay until the foul weather has passed.&#x201d; <br>Now the man has a chance of lessening the gap between himself and the little fox. <br>&nbsp; <br>He inched forward. <br>But just as the man felt he must have gained on the vixen, the snow suddenly deepened. It now came up to his crotch&#x2014;and with the next step the man sat fast in his tracks. <br>He could go neither back nor forward; he couldn&#x2019;t see the hand in front of his face. <br>The blizzard buffeted him from every side, from above and below. <br>&nbsp; <br>As evening drew on, the weather turned wilder, the frost piercing his clothes in spite of their thickness, and he grew so cold that he had to shiver himself to warmth. <br>The man decided to let himself be snowed in. <br>He moved a little while this was happening, so the snow formed a windproof shell around him. <br>&nbsp; <br>He was of medium stature, stout, and bulky about the chest. His features were coarse; his forehead of middling height but broad, giving his face its character. He had small steel-blue eyes, set deep under heavy brows that met in the middle, and a high-bridged, thick nose. The set of his profile and chin could not be made out for the dark-red beard, shot through with silver, which overlaid cheek and jaw, reaching down to his breast. He had grizzled earth-brown hair. A domed birthmark perched high on his left nostril. <br>Such was the man in the snowdrift. <br>&nbsp; <br>The night was cold and of the longer variety. <br>&nbsp; <br>The man broke off his ice shell. <br>He praised the Snow Queen and Jack Frost for the shelter they had given him on this fair patch of ground; from this vantage point he could see far and wide over the white frozen wastes. <br>He now took to pinching and squeezing himself. When he had finished rubbing warmth into the muscles of his upper arms, he pulled on his gloves, braced his hands on the snow ledge, and hoisted himself off his throne. <br>Yes, he was a lucky dog. <br>&nbsp; <br>Having shouldered his rifle and bag, the man didn&#x2019;t slow his pace until he reached the smooth rocks of Lofaklopp, those ice-age remnants high up the mountain, where the snow never lies. <br>There he took off his haversack and removed his gloves, skin shoes, and knitted stockings, laying them to dry on the rock beside him. <br>No, damn it, he took off every stitch and sat there as he was created: in nothing but his skin. <br>He was the child of Earth-Sun&#x2019;s daughter. <br>&nbsp; <br>His guts rumbled and the man discovered that he was hungry; he hadn&#x2019;t tasted a bite since gorging himself on boiled fish before he set off, but that was more than twenty hours ago. <br>He had eaten a bit of ice since then, truth be told, but that was dull and insubstantial fare. He opened the bag: <br>Hand-thick slabs of lamb; rye cakes with sheep&#x2019;s butter, sour as gall, topped with mutton sausage; a dried cod&#x2019;s head; pickled blood pudding; dried fish; curd porridge; and a lump of brown sugar. <br>Yes, all this was in his mess bag. <br>&nbsp; <br>The sun warms the man&#x2019;s white body, and the snow, melting with a diffident creaking, passes for birdsong. <br>&nbsp; <br>At noon the peaks were still bright and there were patches of blue in the sky. The man recalled the untold glorious hours he had spent in the mountains since he was a lad. Nothing could equal the beauty of those days&#x2014;except the new chandelier in the church at Dalbotn. <br>No! The man flings himself flat on the ground: What did he glimpse there? Was it a boulder? <br>He grabbed the spyglass but could see nothing. Mist on the lens. He wiped it off with his sleeve. What? Could it be what he thought it was? It vanished, no, there it came back into view: <br>A fox&#x2019;s head! Yes, the merest shadow of a head. It was the blue. Of course, she must have been on watch there for some time. He closed the spyglass. <br>The vixen gave a bloodcurdling screech. <br>&nbsp; <br>The land thereabouts is featureless and slopes to the east, with low tussocks and shallow gullies. There was no way for the man to intercept the vixen without being seen. So he lay still where he had thrown himself when he spotted her. The vixen sprang onto a rock and began to howl. There she sat, pointing her muzzle at the sky every time she uttered a sound. <br>And so the vixen tried to provoke the man to move. She had probably lost him when he flung himself down. <br>&nbsp; <br>The man lay flat on his stomach. He had managed to twist himself to face north, with his rifle before him, but didn&#x2019;t dare move because there was no rise in the ground between him and the vixen, nothing to hide him from her view. Moreover, his weapon was not loaded. He couldn&#x2019;t prime it without alerting the little fox. <br>He had to think fast if he weren&#x2019;t to lose the vixen like the day before&#x2014;that would be unthinkable. <br>What was he to do? <br>&nbsp; <br>The vixen spun around on the rock and poised, ready to vanish. The man rolled over onto his back, waggling arms and legs in the air. <br>Then he did an about-turn and got on all fours, raising his right leg like a dog pissing on a tussock. <br>He bleated loudly. <br>&nbsp; <br>With antics like these the man managed to delay the vixen&#x2019;s departure. He crept into hiding and took thought while she waited for more wonders to appear. <br>&nbsp; <br>The man loaded his rifle, ramming down half a measure of powder, which would be needed if he were to hit the vixen with his first shot. Putting his hand in his pocket, he fumbled for the tatty little hymnbook he kept there, tore out a page, crumpled it between his fingers, and stuffed it into the barrel. Now it wouldn&#x2019;t whine even if he aimed the weapon straight into the stiff breeze. <br>He worked quickly, moistening the rifle sight with his spittle and dabbing on a speck of lichen. It froze to the metal, he adjusted it and aimed the rifle experimentally; he would be able to make out the lichen, however dark it got. <br>&nbsp; <br>The man straightened up and aimed the gun, leaning forward on his left leg, focusing all his attention on the rock. No, the vixen was nowhere to be seen. <br>He waited for a long time before letting the weapon drop. The vixen wouldn&#x2019;t give him the slip now. Snow covered the land up to the roots of the glacier, not a bare patch of earth to be seen; the vixen would write the tale of her travels on the blank sheet as soon as she embarked on them. <br>Grasping the weapon in both hands, he set off. <br>&nbsp; <br>All day long the vixen ran up hill and down dale, the man following hard on her heels. <br>She was his letter of commission, setting him a task to perform in the material world. <br>&nbsp; <br>When the man emerged from under the giant boulder that blocks off Asheimar, he came within an inch of losing the vixen. <br>He just managed to spot her as she turned three circles and flopped against a stone, skulking down and laying her tail over her muzzle. <br>The man did the same. <br>&nbsp; <br>The rim of daylight was fading. <br>In the halls of heaven it was now dark enough for the Aurora Borealis sisters to begin their lively dance of the veils. With an enchanting play of colors they flitted light and quick about the great stage of the heavens, in fluttering golden dresses, their tumbling pearl necklaces scattering here and there in their wild caperings. This spectacle is at its brightest shortly after sunset. <br>Then the curtain falls; night takes over. <br>&nbsp; <br>Sleep now became so importunate that the man had never known such overpowering odds. It flashed into his mind that he was in fact dying. He felt weak, his head ached, and his breathing was labored. There was a dull ringing in his ears, yet he could still hear a thudding, a hammering. It was his heart. <br>What might that bode? <br>At that very moment the vixen uttered three long-drawn-out warning cries. This was to the east of the man, borne to him on the wind; they struck him like a gust. <br>He jerked. Darting his eyes to the left, he glimpsed there a blue shape&#x2014;it seemed to him a devilish coal-black beast. <br>It vanished. <br>Dead silence. Not even a heartbeat. <br>Was he dead, then? <br>&nbsp; <br>After a considerable time he spied a vixen in the same place as before. She seemed smaller, and all her movements bore witness to exceptional wariness, caution, and cunning. Her behavior was different from before&#x2014;and she didn&#x2019;t make a sound. <br>When this one had flaunted herself before the man for a good while, she vanished from view. He fought the yawns that forced their way up to his mouth. Then he became aware of a movement dead ahead; a foxlike form appeared in the night darkness before his eyes. She pirouetted on her hind legs, seemingly free of the earth, coiling like an eel in a river. <br>A fourth shrieked somewhere out in the night, invisible in the blackness: &#x201c;Argh, argh!&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; <br>The man got a grip on himself. In this part of the country blue foxes were so rare that one alone would be newsworthy. The black one, the shy one, the dancer, and the yelper; they were all the same fox. It could not be otherwise. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all the same fox, all the same fox. They&#x2019;re all the same fox, all the same fox. They&#x2019;re all the same fox, all the same fox&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>He repeated the words over and over like a man groping his way out of a nightmare, crying out in his mind. At last he rallied, and when the tears had run from his eyes the man saw that the fox was still in the same place. <br>And he himself had not moved. <br>It began to snow. <br>It snowed. <br>&nbsp; <br>Blue foxes are so curiously like stones that it is a matter for wonder. When they lie beside them in winter there is no hope of telling them apart from the rocks themselves; indeed, they&#x2019;re far trickier than white foxes, which always cast a shadow or look yellow against the snow. <br>A blue vixen lies tight against her stone, letting the snow drift over her on the windward side.

The snow has drifted and fallen over him until he resembles nothing so much as a hump of ruined wall. <br>The creature must take care not to forget that the man is a hunter. <br>&nbsp; <br>The fox closes her gray eyes. When she opens them again the man has gone. <br>She raises her head. <br>Reverend Baldur Skuggason pulls the trigger. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2004, 2008 by Sj&amp;oac...</p><h2>Greek Sculpture: The Archaic Period (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>"Authoritative and brilliantly illustrated. . . .

The discoveries of modern researchers over the last two decades now support this once derided speculation with evidence revealing that the Sphinx is thousands of years older than Egyptologists have claimed, that the pyramids were not tombs but geomechanical power plants, and that the megaliths of the Nabta Playa reveal complex astronomical star maps that existed 4,000 years before conventional historians deemed such knowledge possible.<br><br>Much of the past support for prehistoric civilization has relied on esoteric traditions and mythic narrative. Using hard scientific evidence from the fields of archaeology, genetics, engineering, and geology, as well as sacred and religious texts, Malkowski shows that these mythic narratives are based on actual events and that a highly sophisticated civilization did once exist prior to those of Egypt and Sumer.

The discoveries of modern researchers over the last two decades now support this once derided speculation with evidence revealing that the Sphinx is thousands of years older than Egyptologists have claimed, that the Great Pyramid was not a tomb but a geomechanical power plant, and that the megaliths of the Nabta Playa reveal complex astronomical star maps that existed 4,000 years before conventional historians deemed such knowledge possible. <br> <br>Much of the past support for prehistoric civilization has relied on esoteric traditions and mythic narrative. Using hard scientific evidence from the fields of archaeology, genetics, engineering, and geology, as well as sacred and religious texts, Malkowski shows that these mythic narratives are based on actual events and that a highly sophisticated civilization did once exist prior to those of Egypt and Sumer. Tying its cataclysmic fall to the mysterious disappearance of Cro-Magnon culture, Before the Pharaohs offers a compelling new view of humanity&#x2019;s past. <br> <br>EDWARD F.

He saw amazing sights, from the wildest, most breathtaking coasts to the smallest of marine creatures. Along the western side of Vancouver Island, Kingzett nosed into an isolated pocket beach where he found something unusual. Amid the mussels, barnacles, and clams were round oysters&#x2015;Olympias. Kingzett noted their presence and paddled on. A decade later when he met Betsy Peabody, executive director of the Puget Sound Restoration Fund (PSRF), he learned that this once ubiquitous native oyster was in steep decline, and he knew that together they would return to this remote spot. </p><p>Rowan Jacobsen, along with Kingzett, Peabody, and a small group of scientists from PSRF and the Nature Conservancy, set out last July to see if the Olys were still surviving&#x2015;and if they were, what they could learn from them. The goal: to use their pristine natural beds, which have probably been around for millennia, as blueprints for the habitat restoration efforts in Puget Sound. The implications are vast. If Peabody and her team can bring good health back to Puget Sound by restoring the intertidal zones&#x2015;the areas of land exposed during low tide and submerged during high tide, where oysters live&#x2015;their research could serve as a model for saving the world's oceans. </p><p>During a time when the fate of the oceans seems uncertain, Rowan Jacobsen has found hope in the form of a small shelled creature living in the lost world where all life began.</p></p><p><p><b>Rowan Jacobsen </b>is the James Beard Award&#x2013; winning author of <i>A Geography of Oysters </i>and <i>Fruitless Fall</i>. Jacobsen's writings on food, the environment, and their interconnected nature have appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Wild Earth</i>, <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Eating Well</i>, and <i>Newsweek</i>. He lives in rural Vermont with his wife and son.</p>"A science-rich yet lambent investigation into the fate of the Olympia oyster... Jacobsen is an artful storyteller, giving the oyster&#x2019;s story an aching bite. He is also a fine explicator, drawing clearly the pivotal role of the oyster in estuarine health...&nbsp; The author ruminates on some fascinating ideas, from prehistoric clam gardens to the role of shellfish in tool-making to the shoreline-based theory of human origins, which holds that inhabitants of the coast benefited from the easy harvest of brain-enriching fish and shellfish. Lovely science writing, and a smart look into where the work of ecological restoration is headed." <b>&#x2013;<i>Kirkus</i></b><p>"In 2008, [Jacobsen] signed on as the literary chronicler of a nine-member expedition to the pristine coast of British Columbia... It's not giving away any punch lines to reveal that Jacobsen's expedition found a remote estuary off the coast of Vancouver Island that is literally paved with Olympia oysters, and that&nbsp; the resulting ecological data may provide the key to a resurgence of the species in bays and raw bars along the Northwest coast. But Jacobsen's experience also provided him with food for thought. Just as agriculture led to the spread of civilization in the Old World, he believes, aquaculture may have spread civilization in the New World... He's equally persuasive in urging the preservation and protection of native shellfish habitats. After all, the oyster is his world - and the world, it seems to me, is his oyster." - <i>Natural History</i></p><p>&#x201c;What too many of us so simply regard as the oyster, Rowan Jacobsen reveals as living gold&#x2014;as currency of coastal cultures, engineer of ecosystems, the champagne toast of societies through the ages. Through Jacobsen&#x2019;s admiring eyes, we see the mystery and the magic in the humble oyster; we see the omen in a creature quietly disappearing from waters that once gave life to us all.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;Will Stolzenburg, author of <i>Where the Wild Things Were</i></b> </p><p><i>&#x201c;The Living Shore</i> is a jewel, a small enlightening book that moves gracefully from the last gasps of the world's smallest oyster to the coastal origins of mankind. Rowan Jacobsen's engaging style makes it all possible and somehow leaves the reader both alarmed and inspired." <b>&#x2013;Jim Lynch, author of <i>The Highest Tide</i></b></p></p><h2>Original Blessing: A Primer in Creation Spirituality</h2><p>NEW BOOK IN EXCELLENT CONDITION .

Decrying the South&#x2019;s economic backwardness and political conservatism, the Roosevelt Administration launched a series of programs to reorder the Southern economy in the 1930s. After 1950, however, the social welfare state had been replaced by the national security state as the South&#x2019;s principal benefactor. Bruce J. Schulman contrasts the diminished role of national welfare initiatives in the postwar South with the expansion of military and defense-related programs. He analyzes the contributions of these growth-oriented programs to<b> </b>the South&#x2019;s remarkable economic expansion, to the development of American liberalism, and to the excruciating limits of Sunbelt prosperity, ultimately relating these developments to southern politics and race relations. By linking the history of the South with the history of national public policy, Schulman unites two issues that dominate the domestic history of postwar America&#x2014;the emergence of the Sunbelt and the expansion of federal power over the nation&#x2019;s economic and social life. A forcefully argued work, <i>From Cotton Belt to Sunbelt</i>, originally published in 1991(Oxford University Press),<i> </i>will be an important guide to students and scholars of federal policy and modern Southern history.</p><p>&#34;&#34;From Cotton Belt to Sunbelt&#34; marks a breakthrough in social and political analysis, showing for the first time how the interconnection between national and regional politics, on the one hand, and government policy, on the other, brought about the transformation of the social economy of the South from the days of the New Deal to the 1980s. Moreover, it is written with verve and clarity and from a wealth of governmental and manuscript sources. All that is hard to beat.&#34;--Carl Degler, Stanford University<p>Bruce J. Schulman is Associate Professor of History at Boston University.</p></p><h2>Joan of Arc: Her Story</h2><p>This biography offers a detailed, truthful look at the life of the famous French saint, from her earliest years as a peasant child to her death, when she was burned at the stake for witchcraft. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>The peasant girl who led an army against the English and placed Charles VII on the French throne has inspired countless books since her death at age 19. While others have claimed Joan the Maid (as she called herself) for every cause from feminism to working-class radicalism, this meticulous volume by two French scholars sticks close to the known facts. The authors make extensive use of contemporary documents that bring to life the turbulent political scene in which Joan operated as well as her forceful personality. Joan followed the directives of voices she believed were sent to her by God; her deep piety, self-assurance, decisiveness, and shrewd intelligence radiate from her letters and from her responses to hostile questioning at the rigged trial that resulted in her being burned alive as a heretic in 1431. General readers may be intimidated at first by a detailed narrative studded with lengthy quotations, but those who persevere will discover a story all the more moving because it is not manipulated to make a modern-day point. This English translation updates the 1986 French volume's bibliography, supplements the biographies in part 2 with sketches of historical figures less familiar outside of France, and generally makes the book more accessible for English-language readers. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"A vivid portrait of the young woman whose intelligence, courage, determination and unshakable faith astonished all of Europe" --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><p> "The work of Pernoud and Clin brings into focus all the information about Joan that is available today...truly an exemplary biography.

This is a striking addition to the growing body of Culture lore, and adds definition and scale to the previous works by using the Earth of 1977 as contrast. The other stories in the collection range from science fiction to horror, dark-coated fantasy to morality tale. All bear the indefinable stamp of Iain Banks&#39; staggering talent.</p><p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. He has since gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels.Accompanied by a lengthy essay, "A Few Notes on the Culture" (1997), these seven arresting short stories and the disturbing novella that provides the title for Banks's latest SF collection all date from 1984&#x2013;1987, the period of his bizarre mainstream novel <i>The Wasp Factory </i>and the extravagant genre novel <i>Consider Phlebas, </i>both cult-inspiring works. In short pieces like "Road of Skulls" and "Piece," Banks turns convention upside down and inside out, with shocker-endings that linger like smoke rising from a crematorium. "Odd Attachment" traces a marooned spaceman and his AI suit on a tortuous survival trek across an uninhabited planet, illustrating Banks's preoccupation with the "self-generative belief system" that applies to both humans and AIs in the Culture, the setting for the title story and some of his SF novels. Viewing Earth and <i>Homo sapiens</i> through the eyes of the Culture, a galactic group-civilization spawned by a handful of humanoid species several thousand years in the past, allows Banks to speculate on his dearest philosophical topics: the preferability of anarchy in space, denunciation of market economies as "synthetic evil," never-ending education for both humans and machines, and genetic manipulation. For all their wrenching images and sadistic twists, Banks's unsettling tales bestow a grim gift, the ability to see ourselves as others might see us. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the first of these, under the Commonwealth, England had much the better, due largely to the outstanding leadership of Robert Blake. The second war was more even. By now Charles II had been restored to the throne. There were a number of fierce battles which went either way, but the war ended with the humiliation of the Dutch burning a large part of the English fleet in the Medway.<br><br>After reviewing the earlier wars, this book goes on to describe the third Anglo Dutch war, fought between 1672 and 1674. This war of shameless aggression was provoked by England, or rather by King Charles and his court, mainly as a matter of commercial greed. It began, before any declaration of war, with an attack on a Dutch merchant convoy proceeding up-Channel.<br><br>In this war, for the first time, England fought in alliance with France, and the French fleet was an important, if ultimately ineffective, part of the fleet which under the leadership first of the Earl of Sandwich, then by James, Duke of York, and finally by Prince Rupert, took on the Dutch fleet led by the brilliant Admiral Michiel de Ruyter.<br><br>At Solebay on the Suffolk coast, de Ruyter surprised the English fleet on the morning of 28 May 1672; in the intense fighting Sandwich&#x2019;s flagship, the Royal James was blown up and he was killed. Overall, the Dutch could claim it as a victory.<br><br>There later followed in 1673 two battles off Schooneveld and then the battle of the Texel. In this fight the French treacherously hung back. De Ruyter&#x2019;s tactical skill in these battles ensured that a planned attempt at invasion was prevented. The war ended with the Allies by no means in unison, and Charles II, obliged by lack of funds to make peace, had nothing to show for a war that should never have been fought.</p><p>Quintin Barry is a solicitor and retired Employment Judge.

'High culture' becomes just one more subculture, one more option, in our midst." How did this happen? According to Chambers, while a definition of culture was being fought over in universities and journals, popular culture "bypassed the question." He argues that the increasing complexity and diversity of popular culture parallels the transformation and growth of cities, and examines transitions, influence and trends in advertising, photography, film, movie theaters, music halls, clothing, radio and the recording industry, noting that the "once-separate historical avant-garde" is now an accepted element in pop imagery.

Substituting the wonder of money for the work of politics, (a dirty business best left to the hired help), the owners of the nation&#x2019;s capital take comfort in the rising Dow Jones average (up 2,500 points in the last three years) and complacently assume that the engines of immortal oligarchy require little else except the chores of routine maintenance.<br><br>Unhappily, the political servants of the corporate state find it increasingly difficult to keep their master&#x2019;s house in order. Both the Republican and Democratic parties find themselves adrift in scandal, discredited by their means of raising campaign money, suspected of crimes against the common good, convicted of neglecting the poor, despoiling the environment, raffling off the prospects of the country&#x2019;s long-term future for the promise of a short-term vote.<br><br>Lewis Lapham received the 1995 National Magazine Award for his essay writing, in which the judges discovered &#x201c;an exhilarating point of view in an age of conformity&#x201d;. With invective all the more deadly for its grace and wit, Lapham presents the portrait of a feckless American establishment gone large in the stomach and soft in the head. His acerbic remarks on the 1996 Presidential election take into account Steve Forbes&#x2019; primary campaign, the non-candidacy of General Colin Powell, the comings and goings of Dick Morris, Senator Bob Dole&#x2019;s triumphant return to television as a pitchman for Air France, the building of Hilary Rodham Clinton&#x2019;s Potemkin village in Iowa, and the sublime vacuity of President Clinton&#x2019;s inaugural address. A previously unpublished and substantial concluding piece looks at the fate of indolent ruling classes through history.<br><br>&#x201c;Our American political classes, being themselves complicit in the well-financed banditry at large in the world, come and go talking of Hilary Clinton&#x2019;s astrologer and the sins of children&#x2019;s television, about the wickedness of the National Arts Endowment and Bill Clinton&#x2019;s Penis. Their insouciance unnerves me. The barbarism implicit in the restless energies of big-time, global capitalism requires some sort of check or balance, if not by a spiritual doctrine or impulse, then by a lively interest in (or practice of) democratic government. The collapse of communism at the end of the Cold War removed from the world&#x2019;s political stage the last pretense of a principled opposition to the rule of money, and the pages of history suggest that oligarchies unhindered by conscience or common sense seldom take much interest in the cause of civil liberty.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Timothy Brennan </b>is professor of comparative literature, cultural studies, and English at the University of Minnesota.

It&#x2019;s like the moment when your favorite tennis shoes start to give you blisters. The way you&#x2019;ve been living your adult life doesn&#x2019;t fulfill you anymore.<br> <br>Dr. Bill Thomas, one of the most innovative thinkers in medicine, explains that a new life phase is beginning to emerge within our society. When the Baby Boom generation came of age in the 1960s and 1970s, they jump-started a cultural revolution that shaped today&#x2019;s society. Now, many feel they are living a life of frenzied disharmony. This out-of-balance feeling is a signal that you are ready for your second coming of age, your life beyond adult�hood. <i>Second Wind</i> illuminates how to recognize and navigate the most challenging and fulfilling developmental stage of life.<br> <br>Life can and should be reimagined. New ways of living and working are waiting to be discovered on the far side of adulthood. Dr. Thomas treats the Baby Boom generation as he would one of his patients, sympathetically exploring its history before recommending a path toward a life rich with developmental opportunities. Predicting that Boomers will choose the path of the Denialist, the Realist, or the Enthusiast, he discusses the behav�iors and attitudes that will provide new and more nourishing fuel for the rest of life&#x2019;s journey: hope and a renewed sense of all that is possible.</p><p>Dr. Bill Thomas&nbsp;is a visionary and internationally recognized expert on aging.

And you'll want to make the journey with him." -- Jane Pauley, author of Your Life Calling<br><br>"Slowing down as we age, in the way that Dr. William Thomas means it, is not only a pleasure, but also a necessity. The brain research is clear: if we don't de-stress and rethink our lives in our fifties and beyond, we can not only lose our longevity but also increase our rates of depression, anxiety, and mental illness down the line. And so I will personally heed Dr. Thomas's advice in <i>Second Wind</i>, and I highly recommend this very practical and accessible book to everyone over fifty." -- Michael Gurian, author of The Wonder of Aging<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Second Wind</i> is a tour de force.

Has Pauline also been 'executed' rather than murdered, and, if so, for what crime? To catch a dangerous killer Wesley has to discover as much as he can about the victim.

When the body of Pauline Brent, a doctor's receptionist, turns up hanging from a yew tree in Stokeworthy churchyard, Wes and his colleagues of the Tradmouth (Devon) police soon determine that she was initially strangled. But who would want to murder Pauline, who by all reports had led a blameless life? While Wes and his team interview people who knew the victim, who mysteriously doesn't have much of a past, an archeological dig unearths the 500-year-old skeleton of a young woman whose broken neck suggests that she was hanged. As the police draw closer to identifying Pauline's killer, 15th-century legal documents just as suspensefully reveal an ancient miscarriage of justice. Besides providing a clever dual mystery, Ellis humanizes her characters with glimpses into their reassuringly ordinary personal lives. (Wes's wife, Pam, for instance, worries about finding child care for their newborn son.) This is a series that just gets stronger with each new book.

According to the authors, Israeli intelligence incorrectly predicted the British withdrawal from Palestine and 1948 Arab invasion; misread Egyptian and Jordanian troop deployment prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and failed to provide adequate warning of the 1973 Arab onslaught. Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, the authors maintain, was "Israel's greatest intelligence failure." A checkered record is described: Israeli intelligence agents arranged the clandestine exit of the Iraqi, Moroccan and Ethiopian Jewish communities; kidnapped Nazi Adolf Eichmann to make him stand trial in Israel; returned Yossele Schumacher, who was snatched to New York by his ultra-Orthodox, anti-Zionist grandparents, to his parents in Israel, and bought classified American documents from American-Jewish intelligence analyst Jonathan Pollard. Black and Morris are the authors, respectively, of Zionism and the Arabs and The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This just may turn out to be the definitive work on the Jewish state's highly touted and often emulated intelligence operations. The authors have crafted a comprehensive and very readable guide to the labyrinthine history of Israel's efforts to spy on its Arab, Palestinian, European, American, and global neighbors from the 1930s to the present. Their ability to provide such encyclopedic coverage is bolstered by access to previously classified and unavailable diaries, reports, and documents. While Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman's Every Spy a Prince ( LJ 7/90) and Victor Ostrovsky and Claire Hoy's By Way of Deception ( LJ 11/15/90) cover this same topic and are worth reading, the first suffers from a tendency to preach about Israeli ethics and the latter is a very personal accounting of spycraft without much historical coverage. Secret Wars avoids these faults and is a "must buy" for any library with any size collection in the area.<br><i>- David P.

One has been endlessly studied and written about. The other has been generally underappreciated and misunderstood. Until now.</b><br><br>Since its birth as a motorcycle company in 1949, Honda has steadily grown into the world&#x2019;s fifth largest automaker and top engine manufacturer, as well as one of the most beloved, most profitable, and most consistently innovative multinational corporations. What drives the company that keeps creating and improving award-winning and bestselling models like the Civic, Accord, Odyssey, CR-V, and Pilot?<br><br>According to Jeffrey Rothfeder, what truly distinguishes Honda from its competitors, especially archrival Toyota, is a deep commitment to a set of unorthodox management tenets. The Honda Way, as insiders call it, is notable for decentralization over corporate control, simplicity over complexity, experimentation over Six Sigma&#x2013;driven efficiency, and unyielding cynicism toward the status quo and whatever is assumed to be the truth. Honda believes in freely borrowing from the past as a bridge to &#x201c;innovative discontinuity&#x201d; in the present. And those are just a few of the ideas that the company&#x2019;s colorful founder, Soichiro Honda, embedded in the DNA of his start-up sixty-five years ago.<br><br>As the first journalist allowed behind Honda&#x2019;s infamously private doors, Rothfeder interviewed dozens of executives, engineers, and frontline employees about its management practices and global strategy. He shows how the company has developed and maintained its unmatched culture of innovation, resilience, and flexibility&#x2014;and how it exported that culture to other countries that are strikingly different from Japan, establishing locally controlled operations in each region where it lays down roots.<br><br>For instance, Rothfeder reports on life at a Honda factory in the tiny town of Lincoln, Alabama, and what happened when American workers were trained to follow the Honda Way, as a self-sufficient outpost of the global company. Could they master Honda&#x2019;s three core principles:<br><br><ul><li><b>Embrace Paradox:</b> Honda encourages respectful disagreement and debate between opposing viewpoints, on matters large and small. New ideas often emerge from conflict.</li><li><b>Real Place, Real Part, Real Knowledge:</b> Honda teaches people to argue using facts, not assumptions. One must go to the factory floor, the showroom, the parking lot, the driver&#x2019;s seat, or the truck bed&#x2014;whatever it takes&#x2014;to get the facts and make a decision that can be supported with data.</li><li><b>Respect Individualism:</b> Honda often hires people with unusual backgrounds and independent streaks. It promotes those who question the status quo and who would probably struggle in organizations that focus on rigid rules and systems.</li></ul><br>Rothfeder shows how the Alabama plant became a new model for manufacturing in America. It can turn out several different types of cars on any given day and up to 300,000 vehicles and engines a year. Its flexible model enables unparalleled responsiveness to market changes and recovery from mistakes.<br><br>As Soichiro Honda himself liked to say, &#x201c;Success can be achieved only through repeated failure and introspection. In fact, success represents one percent of your work, which results only from the ninety-nine percent that is called failure.&#x201d;</p><p><b>JEFFREY ROTHFEDER&nbsp;</b>is a veteran, award-winning journalist and former editor-in-chief at <i>International Business Times</i>.

A year earlier, Honda Motor Company had announced that it would construct its inaugural southern U.S. plant in this tiny hamlet. Because Honda had already made history in 1982 as the first Japanese carmaker in the United States by opening a manufacturing facility in Marysville, Ohio, the news that it was expanding into Alabama captured headlines around the world.</p><p>And raised its share of questions. For one thing, what and where was Lincoln? Other automakers that had already set up shop in southern cities&#x2014;among them Mercedes, Toyota, Nissan, and Hyundai&#x2014;chose large towns like Smyrna, Tennessee; and in Alabama, Huntsville, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa. The companies wanted to be in cosmopolitan areas where the pool of potential workers who had experience with new manufacturing technologies and skill sets was sufficiently large. Moreover, they liked being able to offer visiting executives access to high-quality restaurants and hotels.</p><p>Honda, on the other hand, picked Lincoln precisely because it offered what the company wanted most: anonymity and no big-city spotlights or distractions. Indeed, during the search process for a property in Alabama, Honda executives rejected Birmingham, the first option presented to them, saying it was too big and crowded and, well, messy. And they told the state&#x2019;s industrial development officials that they wanted a site at which they could work unobserved and inconspicuously.</p><p>By those criteria, Lincoln was perfect. Before Honda arrived it was a sleepy flatland, left behind years earlier by farmers and defense factories, barely a pit stop on east&#x2013;west I-20 between Birmingham and Atlanta. Even now, with a world-class automobile factory in its midst, Lincoln is easy to pass by without noticing; it has a few fast-food places to get a bite&#x2014;Waffle House, Taco Bell, and Burger King&#x2014;and a couple of franchise motels, like Days Inn and Econo Lodge. But no signs trumpet the Honda factory on the highway or anywhere in town.</p><p>Considering the depth of Honda&#x2019;s reticence&#x2014;a single-minded self-preoccupation that manifests in the automaker&#x2019;s almost religious regard for internal innovation and individualism and a concomitant ineptness about promoting its accomplishments&#x2014;the public ground breaking at Lincoln for Honda&#x2019;s new 1.7-million-square-foot plant was bound to be perilous. At least the weather cooperated; temperatures reached near eighty that day and the sky was a milky blue. A crowd of a few hundred town residents and invited guests were on hand to watch.</p><p>They heard short speeches welcoming Honda from Governor Don Siegelman, three-decade Lincoln mayor Carroll &#x201c;Lew&#x201d; Watson, and local congressman Bob Riley, as well as convocations given by the ministers of the area&#x2019;s primary black and white churches and gospel songs sung by a choir that combined the best talent from the two. The speakers mainly touted the jobs, tax receipts, influx of supplier factories, and population growth&#x2014;all of it adding up to millions and ultimately billions of dollars in economic gains that would be drawn into the area by what would be built on this one unlikely spot of land. As Mayor Watson said later, with an impish grin and a syrupy drawl, &#x201c;It was as if we won the lottery; in our wildest dreams, no one ever expected Lincoln to be in newspapers as far away as California or Tokyo.&#x201d; (That was the same conversation in which he pointedly took pains to erase any misconceptions I had about the origin of his town&#x2019;s name: virtually all southern cities named Lincoln, he said, are honoring Benjamin, the aide-de-camp to George Washington who accepted British general Charles Cornwallis&#x2019;s surrender at Yorktown, and not Abraham.)</p><p>Honda was represented by its leading global executive, CEO Hiroyuki Yoshino, and lesser officials from Honda of America and the Lincoln plant brain trust. Like every CEO in Honda&#x2019;s history, Yoshino rose through the ranks of engineering and research and development&#x2014;an unspoken but unchallenged prerequisite for those following in the footsteps of Soichiro Honda, who was among Japan&#x2019;s most creative engineers when he founded the company. Other automakers, like other outfits in any industry, tend to fill top jobs with MBAs whose expertise lies in marketing, sales, or finance.</p><p>Having engineers in charge of the business fits Honda&#x2019;s personality perfectly&#x2014;particularly, the company&#x2019;s bias toward an indispensable aspect of the engineer&#x2019;s craft. Namely, the necessity to tear apart design, development, strategic, or manufacturing decisions by trying out alternate solutions arrived at with the same analytical probing and intellectual fervor that produced the original option. Criticizing and rejecting ideas and knowledge deemed to be true&#x2014;inverting conventional wisdom&#x2014;is more valuable at Honda than repeated success using the same concepts. &#x201c;No one will blame you for making a mistake if you tried something new; in fact you may be promoted for that,&#x201d; said Chuck Ernst, who conceived and oversaw the building of the Honda factory in Lincoln, an unconventional facility that resembled and performed like no other auto plant in the world when it was constructed. Before that assignment, Ernst had never built a factory from scratch. &#x201c;However, you could fall out of favor if you&#x2019;re afraid to stray from what worked before&#x2014;no matter how well it worked.&#x201d;</p><p>Or, as Satoshi Okubo, one of Yoshino&#x2019;s predecessors in the CEO&#x2019;s office, put it: &#x201c;At Honda, it&#x2019;s sink or swim. They don&#x2019;t teach you step-by-step; they just throw you into the pool and let you figure it out on your own. If you don&#x2019;t know how to swim at first, you need to be aggressive to survive. We are to try out whatever we think is necessary to take ourselves to the next level.&#x201d;</p><p>The tradition of engineers at the helm has also suffused Honda&#x2019;s culture with the concept of sangen shugi, which some people translate as the three realities. In Honda&#x2019;s interpretation, sangen shugi means see it with your own eyes, go to the spot before making a decision. In other words, find out, say, what the customer wants or how a part should be designed so it can be assembled efficiently on the factory floor by asking the people who can show you&#x2014;not just tell you&#x2014;the answers face-to-face.</p><p>There&#x2019;s almost nothing about Honda&#x2019;s unorthodox DNA that hasn&#x2019;t been informed by the skepticism and curiosity&#x2014;by the unpacking and then reassembling of knowledge and information&#x2014;that characterizes the best of the engineering discipline. However, there is a downside to this: engineer CEOs are not, generally, inspiring or motivating public speakers. That&#x2019;s where having a more traditional sales or marketing background, in which communication skills are necessarily honed to try to persuade people to buy your product, is a distinct advantage.</p><p>And in this respect, in Lincoln, Honda CEO Yoshino did not deviate from the norm. Although gregarious and animated in small groups, at the ground breaking he appeared shy and halting; the speech itself was somewhat ham-fisted.</p><p>Some in the crowd couldn&#x2019;t hear him over the sound of the wind blowing across the open field in which they stood. But those who did pick up what he said heard a repeated theme: Honda has been successful because it is, above all, a company that focuses on doing one thing well&#x2014;making engines that last a long time for cars, motorcycles, and so-called power products like lawn mowers, generators, snowblowers, and weed or garden trimmers. And Honda continually works to perfect this core skill to improve as a company. Yoshino pointed out that the Lincoln plant would be uncommon because Honda would build both cars and engines there; most other automakers don&#x2019;t even manufacture many of their engines and virtually none of them interweaves engine development and manufacturing processes as closely as Honda does to ensure that automobile design decisions are explored holistically.</p><p>And he added: &#x201c;We earn more than ten million customers for these [engine] products every year. That makes us the largest engine maker in the world. The V6 engines we build here in Lincoln will give yet another meaning to the words &#x2018;Powered by Honda.&#x2019; In this way, a phrase so important to our past will have even more power in the future.&#x201d;</p><p>With that and a few more words, the breaking of the ground was about to begin. A Honda public relations person took to the microphone to tell the luminaries on the stage to step down and pick up a shovel.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, you may have noticed that everyone isn&#x2019;t using a shovel,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;Well, Mr. Yoshino spoke earlier about the concept of &#x2018;Powered by Honda.&#x2019; The tiller that he and Mayor Watson are using to break ground is one of those &#x2018;Powered by Honda&#x2019; products. I want you to count down with me to the ground breaking. . . . Count down to this start-up of construction for Honda&#x2019;s new facility in Alabama.</p><p>&#x201c;Five-four-three-two-one. Gentlemen&#x2014;start your engine . . . and shovels.&#x201d;</p><p>The shovels were not the problem. The tiller, however, was. It wouldn&#x2019;t kick over. Yoshino first pulled the starter string smoothly and confidently, no response. Again, with a smile, dead. Then he yanked on it hard&#x2014;there was sweat appearing on his brow and upper lip&#x2014;just a cough from the machine. Now getting more nervous, Yoshino jerked on the rope with force, so hard that someone said it looked like he was going to strain a muscle. It didn&#x2019;t help. People in the audience were growing more and more embarrassed for the CEO and by the obvious irony of a dead Honda engine dedicating the company&#x2019;s crown jewel greenfield factory; they wanted to look away or whispered to their neighbor about how they wished they were anyplace else but here.</p><p>Then, something unexpected happened. Rather than give up or call for help from the Honda maintenance crew in the crowd, Yoshino tackled the balky tiller himself. More comfortable with technical complications than audiences anyway, he bent down and peered into the engine, casually playing with the spark plugs, the carburetor, the gas line. He flipped the choke. It took less than two minutes; then he stood up and pulled the cord. The engine came alive.</p><p>�</p><p>Those who believed that Soichiro Honda would have disapproved of what unfolded that spring afternoon on a nameless plot of land in the Deep South couldn&#x2019;t have been more wrong. Quite to the contrary, Honda-san would have been proud for this reason: though unfortunate, the mishap with the tiller revealed yet again that Honda Motor, the company Soichiro founded some fifty years earlier, is an awkward outfit built on paradox and contradiction, full of enthusiasm and warts, yet wholly original, influential, creative, enterprising, resourceful, and successful&#x2014;just as he was. More than anything, that public faux pas in central Alabama reflected how well his company echoes his uniqueness as an engineer and a businessman and how his unconventional management style and improvised, even intuitive, organizational genius has permanently infected the corporation that bears his name.</p><p>Any number of Honda aphorisms would appropriately frame that Alabama misstep, sayings embedded deeply in the company&#x2019;s culture, but one maxim oft repeated by Soichiro Honda, who was fond of mistakes like these, fits best of all.</p><p>&#x201c;Success,&#x201d; Honda said, &#x201c;can be achieved only through repeated failure and introspection. In fact, success represents one percent of your work, which results only from the ninety-nine percent that is called failure.&#x201d;</p><p>To Soichiro, slip-ups were a sign of progress to come, a motivator to improve.</p><p>Soichiro Honda&#x2019;s business partner, Takeo Fujisawa, the management consulting genius whose personal style and temperament stood in sharp contrast to the founder&#x2019;s but who nonetheless forged a common bond with Soichiro that united the pair for more than two decades, had a more nuanced way of looking at mistakes. To him, it was the fear of failure that drove people to achieve the most, rather than failure itself.</p><p>Fujisawa was adept at shogi, a Japanese version of chess with at least one substantial variation: when you captured an opposing player&#x2019;s piece, it could be redeployed on your side. To Fujisawa that was an apt metaphor for business strategy. As he saw it, by outsmarting the competition, you not only vanquish a rival, you are enhanced by his losses. And the only way to avoid being beaten yourself is by constantly being on alert and ready to respond to the errors in judgment and in practice that could give your competitors an opening.</p><p>To make this point, Fujisawa quoted Kozo Masuda, a champion shogi player in the 1950s whom he idolized. Paraphrasing Masuda, Fujisawa would say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at my best in a match when I&#x2019;m on the edge of victory or defeat. I&#x2019;ve made many careless mistakes in my day and every one of them happened when I had some slack. . . . It&#x2019;s better for me to feel like my opponent&#x2019;s closing in on me.&#x201d;</p><p>But beyond the positive effects of failure, Honda CEO Yoshino&#x2019;s embarrassing moment and the way he recovered from it in Lincoln is still remembered today&#x2014;still mentioned in the auto industry more than a decade later&#x2014;because it exemplifies in miniature the odd traits, the slightly askew culture, that have made Honda one of the most successful multinational companies in the world, profitable every year of its existence.</p><p>As an auto company consultant who helped implement many of Toyota Motor&#x2019;s operational strategies described it: &#x201c;When I first heard about what happened in Lincoln&#x2014;everyone in the industry talked about it&#x2014;I laughed and said, &#x2018;There goes that motorcycle company again trying to play in the big leagues of the auto industry.&#x2019; And then a couple of days later I was driving to work and it hit me: Crap, Honda can make a mistake and rebound quickly, turn a negative into a positive; a few days after Lincoln and now everyone is asking, &#x2018;Could my CEO get the engine going?&#x2019; Probably not&#x2014;and he wouldn&#x2019;t even try. They&#x2019;re nimble and smart. To use a basketball term, they can go small or go big with equal skill.&#x201d;</p><p>That dexterity, he added, explains why Honda&#x2019;s product development, production, and management methods have been quietly studied by most of the other auto companies as well as other industrial firms, seeking to emulate its personality and manufacturing prowess.</p><p>What they&#x2019;ve found is that the Honda Way is unorthodox and in most cases the opposite of the approach chosen by large manufacturers, including all of Honda&#x2019;s chief rivals in the auto industry, which generally are top-down, command-and-control businesses. You don&#x2019;t have to scratch the surface too deeply to see that Honda, instead, is driven by a series of grassroots, Eastern-derived principles that emphasize:</p><ul><li>individual responsibility over corporate mandates;</li><li>simplicity over complexity;</li><li>decision making based on observed and verifiable facts, not theories or assumptions;</li><li>minimalism over waste;</li><li>a flat organization over an exploding flow chart;</li><li>autonomous and ad hoc design, deve...</li></ul></p><h2>The Adventures of Captain Alonso De Contreras: A 17th Century Journey (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Diary entries recount fifty years in the life and career of a seventeenth century Knight of Malta</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)Contreras was born in Madrid in 1582 and left home in 1595 to become a soldier.

This was not achieved through empire building, conquest, large armies, treaties, marriage alliances, trade or any of the other traditional means of exercising power. Indeed England was successful in few of these. Instead she based her power and eventual supremacy on the creation of a standing professional navy which firstly would control her coasts and those of her rivals, and then threaten their trade around the world. <br><br>This emergence of a sea-power brought with it revolutionary ship designs and new weapon-fits, all with the object of making English warships feared on the seas in which they sailed. Along with this came the absorption of new navigational skills and a breed of sailor who fought for his living. Indeed, the English were able to harness the avarice of the merchant and the ferocity of the pirate to the needs of the state to create seamen who feared God and little else. Men schooled as corsairs rose to command the state's navy and their background and self-belief defeated all who came against them. <br><br>This is their story; the story of how seizing command of the sea with violent intent led to the birth of the greatest sea borne empire the world has ever seen.</p><p>David childs is the author of Tudor Sea Power.

All are rooted in a deeply ingrained sense of fairness. But where does this universal instinct come from? This is the driving question at the heart of L. Sun&#39;s The Fairness Instinct.Thinkers from Aristotle to Kant, from Augustine to John Rawls, and religions from Christianity to Confucianism, have offered great insight into the nature and origins of this basic human desire for fairness. Based on the most recent scientific discoveries in behavioral genetics, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, economics, and evolution, Sun argues that the origins of the fairness instinct cannot be found exclusively in the philosophical, social, and political perspectives to which we so often turn; rather, they can be traced to something much deeper in our biological makeup. Taking as his starting point Frans De Waal&#39;s seminal study showing that Capuchin monkeys revolt when they are shortchanged by receiving a less valuable reward than their peers receive for the same task, Sun synthesizes a wide range of research to explore the biological roots of the fairness instinct. He shows that fairness is much more than a moral value or ideological construct; fairness is in our DNA. Combining scientific rigor with accessible and reader-friendly language to relate fascinating stories of animal and human behavior, The Fairness Instinct lays out an evolutionary roadmap for how fairness emerges and thrives under natural selection and how two powerful engines-social living and social hierarchy-have fueled the evolution of this intricate and potent instinct in all of us. Probing into the motives that underlie such phenomena as envy, consumerism, anti-intellectualism, revenge, revolution, terrorism, marriage, democracy, and religion, Sun showcases the power of the fairness instinct to make our history, shape our society, and rule our social lives.</p><p><b>L.

Today, however, the rich tradition of speech communication studies is either reduced to a few quick mentions of Aristotle and Cicero, or at worst, lost altogether. Why have we forgotten where we come from, and more importantly, why are we not sharing those origins with our students? In The Speaker, the authors bring tradition to the forefront of public speaking instruction while also maintaining the skills aspect. The text fuses the ageless speech principles developed during the Classical Period with more contemporary advances. This combination provides students with a strong foundation for developing speeches and presentations for the classroom, the boardroom, or the stage. The authors help students understand the why behind the how of effective public speaking.</p><p></p><h2>Painting with Watercolor, Pen &amp; Ink</h2><p><b>Create worlds of incredible pen, ink and watercolor art with Claudia Nice!</b><br><br>Let best-selling author and artist <b>Claudia Nice</b> show you how to create incredible art in pen, ink and watercolor.

This piercing examination of the manifold ways in which the passing of time operates on the human consciousness unfolds gracefully, and Kincaid inhabits each of her characters&#x2015;a mother, a father, and their two children, living in a small village in New England&#x2015;as they move, in their own minds, between the present, the past, and the future: for, as she writes, "the present will be now then and the past is now then and the future will be a now then." Her characters, constrained by the world, despair in their domestic situations. But their minds wander, trying to make linear sense of what is, in fact, nonlinear. <i>See Now Then </i>is Kincaid's attempt to make clear what is unclear, and to make unclear what we assumed was clear: that is, the beginning, the middle, and the end.<br> Since the publication of her first short-story collection, <i>At the Bottom of the River</i>, which was nominated for a PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, Kincaid has demonstrated a unique talent for seeing beyond and through the surface of things. In <i>See Now Then</i>, she envelops the reader in a world that is both familiar and startling&#x2015;creating her most emotionally and thematically daring work yet.</p></p><p><p><b>Jamaica Kincaid</b> was born in St. John's, Antigua. Her books include <i>At the Bottom of the River</i>, <i>Annie John</i>, <i>Lucy</i>, <i>The Autobiography of My Mother</i>, <i>My Brother</i>, and <i>Mr. Potter</i>, all published by FSG. She lives with her family in Vermont.</p>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>See now then, the dear Mrs. Sweet who lived with her husband Mr. Sweet and their two children, the beautiful Persephone and the young Heracles in the Shirley Jackson house, which was in a small village in New England. The house, the Shirley Jackson house, sat on a knoll, and from a window Mrs. Sweet could look down on the roaring waters of the Paran River as it fell furiously and swiftly out of the lake, a man-made lake, also named Paran; and looking up, she could see surrounding her, the mountains named Bald and Hale and Anthony, all part of the Green Mountain Range; and she could see the firehouse where sometimes she could attend a civic gathering and hear her government representative say something that might seriously affect her and the well-being of her family or see the firemen take out the fire trucks and dismantle various parts of them and put the parts back together and then polish all the trucks and then drive them around the village with a lot of commotion before putting them away again in the firehouse and they reminded Mrs. Sweet of the young Heracles, for he often did such things with his toy fire trucks; but just now when Mrs. Sweet was looking out from a window in the Shirley Jackson house, her son no longer did that. From that window again, she could see the house where the man who invented time-lapse photography lived but he was dead now; and she could see the house, the Yellow House, that Homer had restored so carefully and lovingly, polishing the floors, painting the walls, replacing the pipes, all this in the summer before that awful fall, when he went hunting and after shooting with his bow and arrow the largest deer he had ever shot, he dropped down dead while trying to load it onto the back of his truck. And Mrs. Sweet did see him lying in his coffin in the Mahar funeral home, and she thought then, why does a funeral home always seem so welcoming, so inviting from the outside, so comfortable are the chairs inside, the beautiful golden glow of the lamplight softly embracing every object in the room, the main object being the dead, why is this so, Mrs. Sweet said to herself as she saw Homer, lying all alone and snug in his coffin, and he was all dressed up in brand-new hunting clothes, a red and black plaid jacket made of boiled wool and a red knitted hat, all clothing made by Woolrich or Johnson Bros. or some outdoor clothing outfitters like that; and Mrs. Sweet wanted to speak to him, for he looked so much like himself, to ask him if he would come to paint her house, the Shirley Jackson house, or could he come and do something, anything, fix the pipes, clean the gutters of the roof, check to see if water had leaked into the basement, because he appeared to be so like himself, but his wife said to her, Homer shot the biggest deer of his life and he died while trying to put it in the back of his truck; and Mrs. Sweet was sympathetic to the worldly-ness of the dead, for she could make herself see the army of worms, parasites, who had, without malice aforethought, begun to feed on Homer and would soon reduce him to the realm of wonder and disillusion so sad, so sad all of this that Mrs. Sweet could see then, while standing at the window of the house in which Shirley Jackson had lived and across the way was the house in which old Mrs. McGovern had died and she had lived in it for many years before she became old, she had lived in her house, built in a neoclassical-something style that harkened back from another era, long ago, long before Mrs. McGovern had been born and then became a grown-up woman who married and lived with her husband in the Yellow House and made a garden of only peonies, big white ones that were streaked with a wine-dark red on the petals nearest the stamens, like an imagined night crossing an imagined day, so had been those peonies in Mrs. McGovern&#x2019;s garden and she had grown other things but no one could remember what they were, only her peonies were committed to memory and when Mrs. McGovern had died and so therefore vanished from the face of the earth, Mrs. Sweet had dug up those peonies from that garden, &#x201c;Festiva Maxima&#x201d; was their name, and planted them in her own garden, a place Mr. Sweet and the beautiful Persephone and even the young Heracles hated. The Pembrokes, father and son, mowed the lawn, though sometimes the father went off to Montpelier, the capital, to cast votes for or against, as he felt to be in the best interest of the people who lived in that village in New England, which even now is situated on the banks of the river Paran; and the other people in that village, the Woolmingtons lived always in their house, and the Atlases too, and so also were the Elwells, the Elkinses, the Powerses; the library was full of books but no one went into it, only parents with their children, parents who wanted their children to read books, as if reading books <i>were</i> a mysterious form of love, a mystery that must remain so. The small village in New England held all that and much more and all that and much more was then and now, time and space intermingling, becoming one thing, all in the mind of Mrs. Sweet.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>All that was visible to Mrs. Sweet as she stood in the window, at the window, but so much was not visible to her then, it lay before her, all clear and still, as if trapped on a canvas, enclosed in a rectangle made up of dead branches of <i>Betula nigra</i>, and she could not see it and could not understand it even if she could see it: her husband, the dear Mr. Sweet, hated her very much. He so often wished her dead: once then, a night when he had returned home after performing a piano concerto by Shostakovich to an audience of people who lived in the nearby villages and so felt that they wanted to get out of their homes from time to time, but as soon as they left their homes they wanted to return immediately, for nothing was nearby and nothing was as nice as their own homes and hearing Mr. Sweet play the piano made them sleepy, their heads sometimes suddenly falling forward, and they struggled to keep their chins from landing on their chests and that happened anyway and there would be lurching and balancing and gulping and coughing and though Mr. Sweet&#x2019;s back was turned away from his rural audience he could sense all this and he could feel every twitch, every shudder, as it registered in each individual. He loved Shostakovich and as he played the music written by this man&#x2014;&#x201c;The Oath to the People&#x2019;s Commissar,&#x201d; &#x201c;Song of the Forests,&#x201d; &#x201c;Eight Preludes for Piano&#x201d;&#x2014;the grave sorrows and injustices visited on him flowed over Mr. Sweet and he was very moved by the man and the music that the man made and he wept as he played, pouring all of his feelings of despair into that music, imagining that his life, his precious life was being spent with that dreadful woman, his wife, the dear Mrs. Sweet, who loved making three courses of French food for her small children and loved their company and she loved gardens and loved him and he was least worthy of her love, for he was such a small man, sometimes people mistook him for a rodent, he scurried around so. And he was not a rodent at all, he was a man capable of understanding Wittgenstein and Einstein and any other name that ended in stein, Gertrude included, the intricacies of the universe itself, the intricacies of human existence itself, the seeing of Now being Then and how Then becomes Now; how well he knew everything but he could not express himself, he could not show the world, at least as the world turned up in the form of the population of some small villages in New England, what a remarkable person he was then and had been and in time to come, these people who wore the same socks days in a row and didn&#x2019;t dye their hair after it lost the natural color and the luster it had when they were young and they liked to eat foods that were imperfect, food made limp by natural pathogens or insects for instance, people who worried about the pilot light going out of the boiler and the pipes freezing because the house was cold and then the plumber would have to be called and that plumber would complain about the work of the plumber who came before him because plumbers always found each other&#x2019;s work imperfect; and his audience worried about all sorts of things Mr. Sweet had never heard of because he grew up in a city and lived in a large building that had many apartments in it and when things went wrong, someone named the Super was called to make it right: the Super could change a lightbulb, get the elevator to work again after it had ceased to do so, make the garbage disappear, scrub the floor of the lobby, call the utility company if the utility company had to be called, the super could do many things and in Mr. Sweet&#x2019;s life, when he was a child, the super did them and Mr. Sweet had never heard of them until he came to live with that dreadful woman whom he had married and was now the mother of his children, the mother of his beautiful daughter in particular. The piano concerto came to an end and Mr. Sweet shook himself out of the deep sympathy he felt for the composer of the music and the audience shook themselves into their duck-feather-filled coats, which had trapped the smell of wood smoke from the fires built in fireplaces and wood-burning stoves, that was a winter smell, that was a smell Mr. Sweet hated, the super would have taken care of that smell, this was not a smell of Mr. Sweet&#x2019;s childhood; a dining room in the Plaza Hotel, his mother wearing French perfume, those were the smells of Mr. Sweet&#x2019;s childhood and that then: the mother&#x2019;s perfume, the Plaza Hotel. And he said a good night to those people who smelled as if they lived in rooms where wood was always burning in the wood-stove, and immediately no longer thought of them as they drove home in their Subarus and secondhand Saabs, and he put on his coat, a coat made from the hair of camels, a very nice coat, double-breasted, that the beastly wife of his, Mrs. Sweet, had bought for him from Paul Stuart, a fine haberd...</p><h2>Playgrounds of the Mind: The Sequel to N-Space</h2><p><p><b>The sequel to <i>N-Space</i></b></p><p><i>Playgrounds of the Mind</i> captures the startling range and variety of Larry Niven's spectacular career, from bestselling novels such as<i> Lucifer's Hammer </i>and <i>The Ringworld Engineers</i>, from his classic short stories of science fiction and fantasy, from his thought-provoking essays and non-fiction, from his innovative and seldom-seen work in comics (on such projects as<i> The Green Lantern Bible</i>), to an advance look at Larry Niven's upcoming projects.</p><p>Like<i> N-Space, Playgrounds of the Mind </i>is a feast for Niven's millions of fans-and an impressive tribute to the man Arthur C.

The author argues that the profligacy and moral emptiness of its key players, continues to drive the excesses of Hollywood.</p><p>Veteran show-biz news hound Charles Fleming argues that the short, insanely foolish life of producer Don Simpson (<i>Flashdance</i>, <i>Top Gun</i>, <i>Bad Boys</i>) stands as a larger indictment of Hollywood, and it's hard to argue with him. For one thing, Simpson helped create Tom Cruise, Richard Gere, Will Smith, and Eddie Murphy, and his loud, high-concept, low-IQ school of filmmaking helped launch Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, and Bruce Willis to new heights (or depths). Others may have been responsible for 14 Top Ten pop tunes and 10 Oscar nominations, but nobody had thought to combine pop music and movies in a synergistic way.<p>While Fleming concentrates on Simpson's own antics--car wrecks, career crackups, whacked-out drug and sex orgies, whimsical overspending on brain-dead blockbusters--he does make an excellent case that the entertainment industry as a whole is nutty and slutty. Even the more levelheaded stars who turn up in <i>High Concept</i> turn out to be appalling: Fleming documents the behavior that earned Demi Moore the Hollywood nickname "Gimme More."</p><p>Despite his $60,000-a-month drug habit, Simpson actually did come up with smart ideas, according to many witnesses, and he was sharp enough to know how dumb so many of his colleagues were. Sylvester Stallone, for instance, almost starred in <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i>, and had he not left the project in favor of his notorious stink bomb <i>Rhinestone</i>, viewers would have been stuck with Stallone's rewrite of <i>Cop</i>, from which the star had removed every trace of humor--the very concept that made an ordinary action film, in Murphy's talented hands, a smash hit. In his detailed account of Simpson's bizarre life, Fleming demonstrates why modern movies are the way they are.</p><p>He also proves what a strangely tiny town Hollywood is. Simpson was mixed up with Heidi Fleiss, whose indicted dad was Madonna's pediatrician; his doctors had treated Kurt Cobain and Margaux Hemingway (and one had helped design Miss Piggy); Don Simpson's drug dealer claims he sold drugs to O.J. Simpson the day Nicole Brown Simpson died. The most shocking thing about the book is the <i>Pulp Fiction</i>-like combination of decadent horror and slapstick comedy that constituted everyday life for Don Simpson's cronies. The high life, as described in Fleming's addictively readable book, exemplifies Carrie Fisher's Hollywood mantra: "Good anecdote--bad reality." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"Hollywood didn't want this book to be written, but I'm happy Charles Fleming wrote it. His account is accurate and he is not afraid to tell tough truths. Don Simpson would have liked it."<br>--Joe Eszterhas<p>"This is a cautionary tale of moral failure in the midst of astronomical success -- not just the moral failure of poor dead Don Simpson but the moral failure of the industry he worshipped. Charles Fleming knows the Hollywood turf backwards, forwards, and sideways."<br>--Dominick Dunne</p><p>"Fearless reporting filled with gripping detail.

In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

How can certain individuals reverse incurable disease while others suffer the effects of childhood wounds despite years of therapy? These are the questions readers will explore in the much-anticipated new book from clinical neuropsychologist and biocognitive science founder Dr. Mario Martinez. <br><br>In <i>The MindBody Code, Dr. Martinez challenges us to embrace a radically new paradigm for health and well-being. Readers will not only learn the basics of this fascinating cutting-edge science, but they will also learn to communicate with the body in its own biosymbolic language for results that until this point may have been elusive at best. Martinez reveals the way our cultural beliefs impact our immune system, the pathway to healing the archetypal wounds of shame, abandonment, and betrayal, and much more. </i></p><p>Mario Martinez, is a clinical neuropsychologist who lectures worldwide on the impact of cultural beliefs on health and longevity. His unique approach bridges the fields of psychoneuroimmunology, cultural anthropology, and cultural neuroscience. He lives in Montevideo, Uruguay.

By putting his wisdom into action, we can transform the unhealthy, culturally-based language we mindlessly learned into a mindful, biosymbolic language to bring about health and vitality.

Eight years and eight weeks later, astronaut Neil Armstrong took his "one small step for man, one giant step for mankind." Murray ( Losing Ground ) and Cox, his wife, tell the absorbing story of how that goal was reached, mostly from the point of view of the managers and scientists who made it happen. They trace the design and development of successive spacecraft and boosters, explain how liquid-fueled rocket engines, guidance systems and other components work, and reveal the managerial controversies and technical improvisations that enabled the program to proceed despite serious setbacks. The setbacks are covered in depth; for example, the 1967 ground-test fire in which Gus Grissom and two other astronauts were asphyxiated, and the crisis during Apollo 13's return from the moon when there was a possibility that the astronauts in the space capsule might orbit the earth forever, "a perpetual monument to the space program."

Buy this book."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW<br>What Pultizer Prize-winning humorist Dave Barry did for American history in DAVE BARRY SLEPT HERE and for getting older in DAVE BARRY TURNS FORTY, he does for...everything else in America! The rapacious consumer of overpriced real estate, He Man action figures, and homemade beer sounds off on all the things that make life as we know it both ridiculous and sublime.</p><p>A Greatest Hits package to die for, in which the inimitable, Pulitzer-packing humorist applies himself to taxes, toilets, airbags, baseball, beer commercials, and numerous other American artifacts. A typical bit, from a piece on legalized gambling: &#34;Off-Track Betting parlors are the kinds of places where you never see signs that say, &#39;Thank You for Not Smoking.&#39; The best you could hope for is, &#39;Thank You for Not Spitting Pieces of Your Cigar on My Neck.&#39;&#34; Happy? There&#39;s plenty more where that came from.<br>When I was a teenager, we used to have a Sunday morning ritual in my family. I'd drag myself out of bed and head downstairs to have my breakfast (which, according to the clock, usually should have been more like lunch). My father would greet me with the excited words "You have to hear Dave Barry today!" What proceeded was nothing less than a milk-spewing laugh-fest as I tried to eat my soggy cereal while my father read Barry's column aloud to me. <br><br>I love "Dave Barry's Greatest Hits" because it lets me relive all that spewed milk and those snarfed Rice Krispies. <br><br>If you discovered Barry through his column, this book is a great way to revisit those favorites that you haven't read since they first appeared in the paper. And if you've never read any of Dave Barry's work, then consider yourself warned: Do not attempt to read this book and eat at the same time (unless, of course, the idea of snorting your milk in front of others appeals to you).<br><br>--Cassie Nylen, Copy Assistant<br></p><h2>The Magic Bullet: A Locked Room Mystery</h2><p>St. Paul, Minnesota. October 1, 1917. High above the city, a renowned local financier named Artemis Dodge lies facedown on the floor of his armored penthouse sanctuary, a single bullet hole in his head. Thirty stories up, in the city&#x2019;s tallest building, and not a shred of evidence or sign pointing to anyone having broken into the wealthy man&#x2019;s fortress. It is&#x2014;to all appearances&#x2014;an impossible crime. <br>Enter Shadwell Rafferty: Irishman, St. Paul saloonkeeper, sometime detective, and old friend of the celebrated sleuth Sherlock Holmes. Summoned by Louis B. Hill&#x2014;son of railroad magnate James J. Hill&#x2014;to investigate, Rafferty descends into a world dominated by greedy tycoons and awash in political intrigue and wartime fearmongering. Suspects lurk in every corner of the city&#x2014;including Dodge&#x2019;s beautiful young widow, his slippery assistant, and a shadowy anarchist&#x2014;and Rafferty pursues them from the streets of Ramsey Hill and the rooms of the Ryan Hotel to the labyrinthine caves under the Schmidt brewery. Matching wits with his foes at the police department and his unsavory rival, the St. Paul detective Mordecai Jones, Rafferty knows that in order to bring a killer to justice he must first unravel the riddle of a single bullet fired in a locked room, three hundred feet above the streets of St. Paul.<br>Set during a bitter streetcar strike and amid the clandestine activities of a ruthless commission charged with enforcing wartime patriotism, Larry Millett has created a classic and perfectly executed locked-room mystery in the great tradition of John Dickson Carr. From locked rooms and civil unrest to murder and wartime paranoia, <i>The Magic Bullet</i> presents Rafferty&#x2019;s most challenging case, and its gripping conclusion&#x2014;with a timely assist from Sherlock Holmes&#x2014;finds both Rafferty and Millett at the top of their games.</p><p>Larry Millett was a reporter and architecture critic for the <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i> for thirty years.

Johnston doesn't just come from Newfoundland, remotest of Canada's provinces; he comes from the Avalon Peninsula, the most isolated portion of Newfoundland (and confused in young Wayne's boyish imaginings with the mythical Avalon, where King Arthur sailed to be healed of mortal wounds). It's an apt metaphor for a land that "was the edge of the known world, and looked it." Avalon's natives fiercely resented the 1948 referendum that joined Newfoundland to the Canadian Confederation--especially Johnston's father, the memoir's central character, who keens for lost independence in a manner highly reminiscent of Stephen Dedalus's father in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>. Indeed, parallels with Ireland are evident throughout, not just because the Johnstons are descended from Irish immigrants but because the Newfoundlanders exhibit a similar passionate insularity and zest for feuding among themselves. Johnston's muscular, plainspoken prose bears little resemblance to that of James Joyce, but his themes of exile and loss, loyalty and betrayal, and an ancient culture's ambivalent relationship with modernity resonate with the great writer's most urgent concerns. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Praise for <b>The Colony of Unrequited Dreams</b>:<br><br>"<b>The Colony of Unrequited Dreams</b> is an indispensable masterpiece. It reshapes and animates history with luminous verisimilitude. Every page of Wayne Johnston's stunning novel displays the highest regard for his reader's intelligence and for the art of writing itself...Mr. Johnston has genius in him, and I think haunting, unmitigated, uncanny vision and grace."<br>--Howard Norman<br><br>"This splendid, entertaining novel is both a version of David Copperfield transposed to twentieth-century Newfoundland and an evocation of vanished ways of life in a place caught in tumultuous political changes. Rich and complex, it offers Dickensian pleasures."<br>--Andrea Barrett<br><br>"A novel of cavernous complexity that nevertheless does not overwhelm the reader, who can repose in pure narrative."<br>--Luc Sante, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"As absorbing as fiction can be-and a marvelous introduction to the work of one of our continent's best writers."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br>"Wayne Johnston is a brilliant and accomplished writer, and his Newfoundland--boots and boats, rough politics and rough country, history and journalism--during the wild Smallwood years is vivid and sharp."<br>--Annie Proulx<br><br>"Grand and operatic...this brilliantly clever evocation of a slice of Canadian history establishes Johnston as a writer of vast abilities and appeal."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br>"A mighty accomplishment: Here's a novel that is as much a tale of two people as it is a history of the harsh, odd, and ultimately fascinating land from which they hail. There is indeed more to Newfoundland than salt cod and tundra, and Johnston brings it all to life."<br>--Chris Bohjalian, <i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i><br><br>"A long, impassioned, absorbing novel...bravura storytelling."<br>--Dennis Drabelle, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"A capacious, old-fashioned summer hammock of a book--the kind you fall into, enchanted, and hate to leave...I wouldn't have missed the trip for anything."<br>--Dan Cryer, Newsday<br></p><h2>War of Two: Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and the Duel that Stunned the Nation</h2><p><b><b>A provocative and penetrating investigation into the rivalry between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, whose infamous duel left the Founding Father dead and turned a sitting Vice President into a fugitive.</b></b><br><br>In the summer of 1804, two of America&#x2019;s most eminent statesmen squared off, pistols raised, on a bluff along the Hudson River. Why would two such men risk not only their lives but the stability of the young country they helped forge?&nbsp;<br><br>In <i>War of Two</i>, John Sedgwick explores the long-standing conflict between Founding Father Alexander Hamilton and Vice President Aaron Burr. Matching each other&#x2019;s ambition and skill as lawyers in New York, they later battled for power along political fault lines that would decide&#x2014;and define&#x2014;the future of the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>A series of letters between Burr and Hamilton suggests the duel was fought over an unflattering comment made at a dinner party. But another letter, written by Hamilton the night before the event, provides critical insight into his true motivation. It was addressed to former Speaker of the House Theodore Sedgwick, a trusted friend of both men, and the author&#x2019;s own ancestor.&nbsp;<br><br>John Sedgwick suggests that Hamilton saw Burr not merely as a personal rival but as a threat to the nation. It was a fear that would prove justified after Hamilton&#x2019;s death...<br><br><b>INCLUDES COLOR IMAGES AND ILLUSTRATIONS</b></p><p><b>John Sedgwick</b> is the bestselling author of thirteen books, including&nbsp;<i>Blood Moon</i>,&nbsp;<i>War of Two,&nbsp;</i>his acclaimed account of the duel between Hamilton and Burr, two novels, and the family memoir&nbsp;<i>In My</i>&nbsp;<i>Blood</i>. A longtime contributor to&nbsp;<i>GQ</i>,&nbsp;<i>Newsweek</i>,&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Atlantic</i>, he wrote the first national expose of the exploits of Whitey Bulger in&nbsp;<i>GQ</i>&nbsp;in 1992.<p>The case of dueling pistols owned by Hamilton&#x2019;s good Federalist friend New York senator Rufus King. Similar to the Robert Wogdon flintlock pistols used in the fatal duel between Hamilton and Burr, these were made by H.W. Mortimer. They were never fired but demonstrate that such equipment was de rigueur for a gentleman of the political class and indicate the elaborate machinery involved in defending one&#x2019;s honor.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p>One fall afternoon several years ago, I was in the reading room of the Massachusetts Historical Society, a splendid brick bastion in Boston&#x2019;s leafy Fenway neighborhood. I was prowling through the society&#x2019;s extensive collection of Sedgwick family papers for a book I was writing about my family&#x2019;s history when the head librarian, Peter Drummey, came up and tapped me on the shoulder and said he had something to show me.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got this one on display up front,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Come, you should see it.&#x201d; He led me through a series of rooms to an exhibition space showing the society&#x2019;s prized holdings in long glass cases. Peter stopped beside one of them and pointed toward a wrinkled letter, yellowed with age, its once-black ink long since faded to brown, that was propped up on glass. &#x201c;There. Take a look.&#x201d;</p><p>I bent over the case. &#x201c;New York, July 10, 1804,&#x201d; I read out.</p><p>My Dear Sir</p><p>I have received two letters from you since we last saw each other&#x2014;that of the latest date being the 24 of May. I have had in hand for some time a long letter to you, explaining my view of the course and tendency of our Politics, and my intentions as to my own future conduct. But my plan embraced so large a range that owing to much avocation, some indifferent health, and a growing distaste for Politics, the letter is still considerably short of being finished&#x2014;I write this now to satisfy you, that want of regard for you has not been the cause of my silence&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait, this isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Peter nodded. &#x201c;Yes&#x2014;Alexander Hamilton&#x2019;s last letter. Written the night before he was shot.&#x201d; By the sitting vice president Aaron Burr, he need hardly have added, in the famous duel at Weehawken, New Jersey, in 1804, an event that Henry Adams called the most dramatic moment in the politics of the early Republic.</p><p>&#x201c;And look, it&#x2019;s to one of yours.&#x201d; He beamed. &#x201c;His good friend and legislative ally Theodore Sedgwick.&#x201d; Of course&#x2014;the name was scrawled hastily across the bottom.</p><p>I&#x2019;d known about the letter, but I&#x2019;d never seen it. Theodore was my great-great-great-grandfather. A career politician, he&#x2019;d helped push Hamilton&#x2019;s economic agenda through the House when he was a representative from Massachusetts, and ultimately rose to become Speaker of the House for the fateful election of 1800 that wrested control away from his Federalist Party and turned it over to Thomas Jefferson and the Republican &#x201c;Jacobins,&#x201d; as he thought of them, alluding to the bloodthirsty radicals of the French Revolution. Much to Hamilton&#x2019;s distress, Theodore had tried fruitlessly to steer the election to Burr, a friend from the Berkshires. Still, Theodore had been one of the only politicians who&#x2019;d remained a trusted friend of both men, which was why Hamilton was writing him then.</p><p>We will return to the letter later, in its time. Taken out of context, it may seem tangential and, unusually for Hamilton, wildly overblown. It is likely to defy expectations as to why Hamilton crossed the Hudson at daybreak and faced his doom. In a few choice sentences, Hamilton offered a better explanation about his part in the duel, and a better prediction of what would come from it, than he did anywhere else. Theodore Sedgwick never responded, since by then there was no one to respond to.</p><p>When earlier members of the family encountered the letter, they could see its value to history, for several added urgent notations on the back before they passed the letter down to the next generation. All conveyed the same message: <i>This letter must be preserved.<br></i><br>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The Fatal Dinner</p><p>Searching for the true origins of the fatal hatred between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr is like trying to trace the wind to its source. It is easier to detail how the gusts are knocking tree limbs about. There was never any question that Burr shot Hamilton in anger. As for why, everyone turned to a remarkable series of letters, eleven in all, that Hamilton and Burr, or their surrogates, volleyed back and forth in the run-up to the slaughter and that filled the newspapers afterward. The letters have much of the quality of legal arguments, as befits the work of the two most prominent lawyers in the city, as each tried to pin the blame on the other, and they make up a duel of their own, a war of words.</p><p>While each man clearly disdained the moral character of the other, the issue at hand was far more limited, and more precise, as it turned, remarkably, on a single word, spoken in haste at a dinner party in Albany that February, in the midst of an abominable winter that, from November to May, was the coldest and snowiest on record. Only the steep roofs of the city&#x2019;s Dutch houses were clear of the otherwise endless freezing white. The event was held at the State Street home of a powerful local judge named John Tayler, whose mouth seemed always down turned in displeasure. He ran nearly everything in town from the waterworks to the local New York State Bank, which he&#x2019;d conveniently located directly across the street, and he was at work on plans for a new granite statehouse a few blocks away. The city had long been so Dutch that, it was said, even the dogs barked in Dutch. The Reformed Protestant Dutch Church still commanded one end of State Street&#x2014;but a sturdy new Episcopal church had risen at the other, reflecting the developing political tensions of the city.</p><p>Tayler had invited in a few gentleman friends who were staying in the city for an ample repast before a roaring fire. The men duly arrived by sleigh on the snow-packed street. Their cheeks must have been raw as they came stamping into the front hall, their top hats and capes dusted with white. Federalists all, they dressed in the Federalist fashion; for clothing, too, was divided by party. Unlike Republicans, these good Federalist men all wore traditional knee-high silk stockings and buckled shoes, eschewing the blowsy shirts and crude trousers affected by the Republicans. <i>Or worse.</i> Even on formal occasions, President Jefferson was known to lounge about the President&#x2019;s Mansion in a dressing gown and slippers.</p><p>The purpose tonight, however, was not mere conviviality. Since this was Albany in an election season, and one that featured the almost lubricious prospect of the disgraced vice president Aaron Burr&#x2019;s attempt to seize the governor&#x2019;s chair, the topic would be politics and, for a diversion, more politics. But for its designation as the state capital, after all, Albany would have remained what it once was: a nice piece of land along the Hudson, rich in strawberries. And these men possessed political opinions of value. Among them were the eminent James Kent, chief justice of the New York State Supreme Court, and the Dutch aristocrat Stephen Van Rensselaer, the eighth patroon, or lord of the manor, a onetime candidate for governor himself whose estate, Rensselaerswych, once encompassed all of Albany. But the prize guest of the evening was Alexander Hamilton.</p><p>In his younger days, Hamilton had cut a girlish figure, wasp-waisted, slim limbed, with none of the manly chest you&#x2019;d associate with an orator who could dominate a hall for hours. He&#x2019;d had a dancer&#x2019;s grace, too, pirouetting and gesturing as he kept up an endless stream of talk. (No one had ever talked as much as Hamilton&#x2014;the world might have drowned in his words.) Now it was only the talk anyone remembered. At forty-nine, he&#x2019;d aged noticeably, thickened up, slowed. Even his electric, violet-blue eyes had dimmed, like a fire that had burned down to embers. And his hair, once a lustrous strawberry blond&#x2014;a token of his Scottish heritage, it was said&#x2014;had gone pale and brittle, but Hamilton still wore it straight back, clasped in his trademark club behind.</p><p>America was still a thinly populated country of only a few million free whites, most of them clumped in a few cities from Georgia to the Massachusetts coast that was not yet called Maine. If the elite weren&#x2019;t related by blood or marriage, they&#x2019;d served together in the war or gone to college together. So here, Hamilton knew Kent from his earliest days as a lawyer, and he knew Van Rensselaer because Van Rensselaer was married to Hamilton&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s sister. But, of course, familiarity doesn&#x2019;t always guarantee warmth. Among intimates, a slight can cause a cooling, and then chill into an icy fury, and so the political world of the young America was driven by the dual polarities of Anton Mesmer, the German physician who believed that everyone and everything is held together by a magnetic force. Those who loved, loved like newlyweds. Those who hated, hated like demons. Thinking he was among men he loved and who loved him, Hamilton ventured an opinion of a man he didn&#x2019;t. When questioned about Burr&#x2019;s candidacy for governor of New York, Hamilton was dismissive, but, being Hamilton, he expressed himself with memorable acuity. He said that he found Burr to be &#x201c;dangerous.&#x201d; He said other things too, but that was the only one that mattered.</p><p>Hamilton had said so many words, it was probably inevitable that he would say a wrong one. This was a wrong one, and no more words from him could make it right. For there was another man there that night, one whom Hamilton failed to take into account. It was Tayler&#x2019;s young son-in-law Dr. Charles D. Cooper, who was staying over. He was so taken by Hamilton&#x2019;s fevered denunciations of the vice president that he did something dangerous. He jotted down a summary for a political friend in Manhattan, and that man&#x2014;unidentified&#x2014;must have found the comments of larger interest, for he passed them along to the <i>Evening Post</i>&#x2019;s editor, William Coleman, who was eager to run them, but with a disclaimer in case Burr take offense and make a challenge against him. The editor persuaded Hamilton&#x2019;s father-in-law, the former New York senator General Philip Schuyler, to add a line expressing doubt that Alexander Hamilton would say anything so harsh about Burr after he&#x2019;d pledged neutrality in Burr&#x2019;s gubernatorial contest. That was a howler. Everyone knew that Hamilton had been anything but neutral in that election.</p><p>Up in Albany, Dr. Cooper read the Schuyler note in the <i>Post</i>, and he took offense at Schuyler&#x2019;s insinuation that he&#x2019;d gotten the story wrong or possibly had made it up entirely. Furious, he wrote a stiff letter to the Federalist <i>Albany Register</i>, to reiterate that Hamilton absolutely had called Burr &#x201c;dangerous,&#x201d; and that was not all. He added, tantalizingly, &#x201c;I could detail for you a still more despicable opinion which Mr. Hamilton has expressed to Mr. Burr.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Still more despicable.</i></p><p>That did it.</p><p>As Burr told a friend later, with the lightly veiled anger that was the purest expression of his breeding: &#x201c;[Hamilton] had a peculiar talent of saying things improper and offensive in such a manner as could not well be taken hold of.&#x201d; Dr. Cooper&#x2019;s letter in the <i>Register</i> didn&#x2019;t come to Burr&#x2019;s attention for a full two months, in the middle of June, by which time Hamilton had succeeded in snatching the governorship from him in humiliating fashion: Burr lost by the greatest margin of any gubernatorial candidate in the state. Burr was not inclined to be forgiving. He intended to extract from Hamilton the full meaning of Cooper&#x2019;s words, if he had to use pincers to do it.</p><p>On June 18, 1804, he dispatched a note to Hamilton at his law office in New York.</p><p>Sir:&#x2014; I send for your perusal a letter signed Charles D. Cooper, which, though apparently published some time ago has but very recently come to my knowledge. Mr. Van Ness, who does me the favor to deliver this, will point out to you that clause of the letter to which I particularly request your attention.</p><p>You must perceive, sir, the necessity of a prompt and unqualified acknowledgement or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertions of Dr. Cooper.</p><p>I have the honor to be,<br>Your obedient servant,<br>Burr.</p><p>With that, the game was on. Those eleven letters passed between them, but when the third, from Burr, declared that he had been dishonored, it became clear that the men would be headed across the Hudson to the dueling ground in Weehawken to resolve the matter at dawn with pistols.</p><p>BUT IT IS the rare lethal dispute that stems from a single word, or even several words. And, while &#x201c;dangerous&#x201d; was insulting, and &#x201c;despicable&#x201d; more so, the words merely evoked a string of calumnies that Hamilton had leveled against Burr at every presidential election up through the last one, the epic contest of 1800, when Jefferson and Burr tied in the Electoral College, throwing the matter to the House of Representatives. While Hamilton had always disdained Jefferson, he loathed Burr so utterly that he fought to counter every attempt by the Federalists to cut a deal with him that would award him the presidency, not Jefferson. It is a mark of Hamilton&#x2019;s aversion to Burr that he embraced the anti-Christ instead.</p><p>As to Burr, there is nothing in his favour. His private character is not defended by his most partial friends. He is bankrupt beyond redemption, except by the plunder of his country. His public principles have no other spring or aim than his own aggrandizement.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If he can, he will certainly disturb our institutions to secure to himself permanent power and with it wealth. He is truly the Catiline of America.</p><p>As every classicist knew, the dissolute Catiline was one of the greatest traitors of the classical age, leading troops against the Roman Republic in a monstrous conspiracy that was foiled by Cicero, the canny orator in whom Hamilton may have seen a little of himself.</p><p>But Hamilton&#x2019;s political antipathy dated back to the presidential contest of 1792, when Burr rather audaciously put himself forward as a vice presidential candidate for the nascent Republican Party against the Federalist incumbents, Washington and Adams. At that point, Burr had been elected New York assemblyman, then appointed attorney general by the governor, who later persuaded the Assembly to make him senator from New York just the year before his vice presidential bid. He was hardly a political threat to the Federalists, and certainly not in a campaign against Washington. Yet Hamilton savaged him:</p><p>I fear [Burr] is unprincipled both as a public and private man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I take it he is for or against nothing but as it suits his interest or ambition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am mistaken if it be not his object to play the game of confusion and I feel it a religious duty to oppose his career.</p><p>A <i>religious</i> duty, no less. Divinely inspired, and permanent. And this for a man who went on to garner just one electoral vote, from South Carolina.</p><p>While Hamilton did not hesitate to say such things, and more, against Burr, Burr never responded in kind, preferring to answer Hamilton&#x2019;s contempt with silence, which may have been all the more infuriating. Hamilton&#x2019;s vituperation was unanswerable in any case, as it stemmed from something far deeper than any transient political disagreement but may have been embedded in his psyche. But in seeing evil in Burr, he brought some out in himself. The duel did not derive from circumstances, but from the essence of who these men were and aspired to be.</p></p><h2>The Glory: A Novel</h2><p>Continuing the story that began with The Hope, an epic story finds point man Zev Barak, CIA-connected Emily Halliday, and aging Mossad officer Sam Pasternak surviving such moments as the Entebbe raid. Reprint.</p><p>In The Hope, world-famed historical novelist Herman Wouk told the riveting saga of the first twenty years of Israel&#39;s existence, culminating in its resounding triumph in the Six-Day War, which amazed the world as few events of this turbulent century have. With The Glory, Wouk rejoins the story of Israel&#39;s epic journey in one of his most compelling works yet. From the euphoric aftermath of that stunning victory in 1967, through the harrowing battles of the Yom Kippur War, the heroic Entebbe rescue, the historic Camp David Accords, and finally the celebration of forty years of independence and the opening of the road to peace, Wouk immerses us in the bloody battles, the devastating defeats, the elusive victories.Herman Wouk (born May 27, 1915) is an bestselling American author, with a number of notable novels to his credit, including The Caine Mutiny, The Winds of War, and War and Remembrance. He was born in New York City, into a Jewish family that had immigrated from Russia, and received an A.B. from Columbia University. He was first a radio scriptwriter, and worked with Fred Allen, then in 1941 worked for the US government on radio spots selling war bonds. Wouk then joined the United States Navy and served in the Pacific Theater, an experience he later characterized as educational; &#34;I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans.&#34; His first ship was the USS Zane, then he was second-in-command on the Southard. He started his writing career onboard, working on a novel during his off-duty hours. He married Betty Sarah Brown in 1945, with whom he had three sons, became a fulltime writer in 1946, and published his debut novel, Aurora Dawn in 1947. In 1952, The Caine Mutiny received the Pulitzer Prize. In 1998, he received the Guardian of Zion Award.</p><h2>Return of the Shadow; History of the LOTR Part One</h2><p>In this sixth volume of The History of Middle-earth the story reaches The Lord of the Rings. In The Return of the Shadow (an abandoned title for the first volume) Christopher Tolkien describes, with full citation of the earliest notes, outline plans, and narrative drafts, the intricate evolution of The Fellowship of the Ring and the gradual emergence of the conceptions that transformed what J.R.R. Tolkien for long believed would be a far shorter book, 'a sequel to The Hobbit'. The enlargement of Bilbo's 'magic ring' into the supremely potent and dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord is traced and the precise moment is seen when, in an astonishing and unforeseen leap in the earliest narrative, a Black Rider first rode into the Shire, his significance still unknown. The character of the hobbit called Trotter (afterwards Strider or Aragorn) is developed while his indentity remains an absolute puzzle, and the suspicion only very slowly becomes certainty that he must after all be a Man. The hobbits, Frodo's companions, undergo intricate permutations of name and personality, and other major figures appear in strange modes: a sinister Treebeard, in league with the Enemy, a ferocious and malevolent Farmer Maggot.<br><br>The story in this book ends at the point where J.R.R. Tolkien halted in the story for a long time, as the Company of the Ring, still lacking Legolas and Gimli, stood before the tomb of Balin in the Mines of Moria. The Return of the Shadow is illustrated with reproductions of the first maps and notable pages from the earliest manuscripts.<br></p><p>CHRISTOPHER TOLKIEN is the third son of J.R.R. Tolkien. Appointed by Tolkien to be his literary executor, he has devoted himself to the editing and publication of unpublished writings, notably <em>The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales,</em> and <em>The History of Middle-earth</em>.<br><br>J.R.R. TOLKIEN&nbsp;(1892&#x2013;1973) is the creator of Middle-earth and author of such classic and extraordinary works of fiction as <em>The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, </em>and <em>The Silmarillion</em>. His books have been translated into more than fifty languages and have sold many millions of copies worldwide.Collectively, these volumes are marketed as "The History of The Lord of the Rings" and tell alternate stories of the siege of Middle-earth and Sauron's defeat. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Principles of Economics</h2><p>This fourth edition teaches the tools and principles that are standard for introductory economics, in a way that students can see the applications for the U.S. and world economy. The facts, anecdotes, and explanations have been scrutinized and updated throughout. Some new examples include high-profile topics at key points, like using the rise in demand for sand from fracking for principles of supply and demand, or explaining how the Federal Reserve is now conducting monetary policy by varying the interest rate paid on bank reserves. Tim Taylor has provided a complete updating of numerical graphs and statistics. In addition, this book has been structured since the first edition to mix in international topics and to consider product, labor, and capital markets side by side, which helps it apply easily to so many of the topics now in the news: effects of globalization on growth and labor markets, budget deficits, the minimum wage, health insurance, and many more.

Lavishly illustrated, it begins with an in-depth exploration of the different materials, techniques, and dyeing processes used in the creation of these sumptuous fabrics before exploring the central importance of cloth to Indian life and culture from ancient times to the present day. Special features focus on objects of historical importance, including a Kashmir map shawl, Tipu Sultan&#x2019;s tent, and a remarkable 18th-century temple hanging from South India.<br> &nbsp;<br> While many are familiar with Mughal velvets, western-market chintzes, or rural embroideries, for example, this book will surprise, inspire, delight, and inform with an extraordinary range of material, much of it new. Along with presenting great historical masterpieces, the importance and variety of the basic fibers&#x2014;silk, cotton, wool&#x2014;from which Indian textiles are traditionally made is emphasized, and the remarkable techniques of weaving, printing, dyeing, and embroidery that have made them prized across the world are illustrated in specially taken photographs.</p><p><b>Rosemary Crill</b> is a senior curator in the Asian Department at the V&amp;A.</p><h2>Season of Fear (A Cab Bolton Thriller, 2)</h2><p><b>"A HURRICANE-FORCE THRILLER." --<i>PETERBOROUGH TELEGRAPH</i></b><b><i><br></i></b><b>"IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY." --LINDA CASTILLO, <i>NYT</i>-BESTSELLING AUTHOR</b><b><br></b><b>"ANOTHER SMASH HIT BY FREEMAN!" --FIVE-STAR READER REVIEW</b><br><b><br></b><b>#1 bestselling author Brian Freeman returns to the sun-drenched beaches of Naples, Florida, and the idiosyncratic world of Detective Cab Bolton in this "brilliant" and "chilling" story of political intrigue and murderous revenge that will keep you guessing until the very end.</b><br><br>Attractive and popular politician Diane Fairmont is running for the Florida governorship, but a chill is cast over the campaign when she receives an anonymous note announcing the return of the assassin who killed her husband ten years earlier.<br><br>As Bolton struggles to penetrate the veil of secrecy surrounding the Fairmont campaign, he begins to realize that the death threat is not the only danger faced by the campaign staff.

In the decade after its first publication in 1966, the debates over <i>Workers and Capital</i> produced new methods of analysis and a new vocabulary for thousands of militants, helping to inform the new forms of workplace, youth, and community struggle. Concepts such as &#x201c;neocapitalism,&#x201d; &#x201c;class composition,&#x201d; &#x201c;mass-worker,&#x201d; &#x201c;the plan of capital,&#x201d; &#x201c;workers&#x2019; inquiry&#x201d; and &#x201c;co-research&#x201d; became established as part of the Italian Left&#x2019;s political lexicon. Five decades since it was first published, <i>Workers and Capital</i> remains a key text in the history of the international workers&#x2019; movement, yet only now appears in English translation for the first time. Far from being simply an artefact of the intense political conflicts of the 1960s, Tronti&#x2019;s work offers extraordinary tools for understanding the powerful shifts in the nature of work and class composition in recent decades.</p><p><b>Mario Tronti</b> is a philosopher and political scientist best known for co-founding the journals <i>Quaderni Rossi</i> and <i>Classe Operaia</i>.&#x201c;Every generation of revolutionary anti-capitalists has to come to terms with how to read afresh the classic formulations of Marx and Lenin in ways appropriate to the conditions of their times. How Tronti and some of his close colleagues did this in the 1960s is a spectacular and inspirational example of how to re-theorize class formation and the practices of class struggle from a ground-up and workerist perspective. While our contemporary world may be very different, there is much to be learned not only conceptually but also methodologically from Tronti&#x2019;s brilliant and incisive interventions at all levels in the politics of his era.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;David Harvey</b><br><br> &#x201c;Tronti&#x2019;s analyses of capital and the potential to overthrow it, which provided a beacon for generations of Italian radicals, have lost none of their power today.

Some readers recall events or buildings because they lived through that particular time. Youthful readers, familiar only with a largely forlorn city, are frequently astounded by images of a town that once pulsated with energy. Most of these pictures don&#39;t depict important or cataclysmic moments in the city&#39;s history, although there are shots of famous people visiting Detroit, from John F. Kennedy speaking to a downtown crowd, to Frank Sinatra performing at Cobo Hall. But the majority are simply images capturing a time and place that are no more.

It would be better if you had never been born." </blockquote><p></p><p>Thomas Ward is the apprentice for the local Spook, who banishes boggarts and drives away ghosts. But now a new danger is threatening Tom's world: the witches are rising and the three most powerful clans are uniting in order to conjure an unimaginable evil. </p><p>Tom and the Spook set out to stop the witches before they unleash the demon. But when Tom finds himself on his own, he wonders if he has the courage and cunning to defeat the most powerful enemy he has ever encountered.</p></p><p><p>Joseph DELANEY is the author of the internationally best-selling The Last Apprentice series, which is now a major motion picture, <em>Seventh Son</em>. He is a former English teacher who lives in the heart of boggart territory in Lancashire, England. His village has a boggart called the Hall Knocker, which was laid to rest under the step of a house near the church.</p>Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Apprentice witch-hunter Tom Ward and his master, the Spook, must now travel into deep enemy territory. The three witch covens of Pendle Hill have been at odds for a long time, but somehow they've been persuaded to put aside old enmities. The aim of this unholy alliance is no less than raising the Devil himself. The key to defeating the witches may rest in a set of trunks willed to Tom by his mysterious mother, but they have been stolen by the Malkin clan, along with Tom's older brother and his family. Delaney does a good job of tying in information from previous books, but the prosaic writing style means the story only occasionally achieves an atmosphere of excitement and dread. Still, fans of the series will welcome the surprising revelations and further questions unveiled in this chapter of the tale.&#x2014;<i>Christi Esterle, Parker Library, CO</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Until his writing, the intricate knots, interlacings, and spirals used in illuminating The Book of Kells and in decorating craftwork and jewelry seemed almost impossible, "the work of angels." In this pioneering work, George Bain shows how simple principles, no more difficult than those used in needlecraft, were used to create some of the finest artistic works ever seen. He also explains how you can use these principles in re-creating artifacts and in creating your own Celtic designs for art and craft work or even for recreational use.<br>Step-by-step procedures carefully introduce the simple rules and methods of Celtic knot work and the well-known designs from the great manuscripts and stone work. Later chapters build up to complex knot work, spiral work, and key pattern designs, with special coverage of alphabets and the stylized use of animals, humans, and plants. Altogether over 225 different patterns are presented for your use, with hundreds of modification suggestions, 110 historical and modern artifacts showing designs in use, a great number of letters including six complete alphabets and 25 decorative initials, and a number of animal and human figures used in the original Celtic works.<br>Artists, students, craftspeople, even children can work with these patterns and instructions for creating dynamic designs for use in leather work, in embroidery and other needle work, in metalwork, jewelry making, card design, borders, panels, illuminations, and in countless other ways. Mathematicians will find a great deal of pleasure in the geometric principles on which the patterns are based. Art historians and others interested in studying Celtic art will find a great number of outstanding art works and the best presentation in English for understanding Celtic design.</p><p></p>George Bain clearly demonstrated in his classrooms, to judge from pupils&#39; work here illustrated, hat through practice and application in his methods of constructing decoration, anyone with the initial interest can release this innate interest to beautiful and mark out the impress of their individuality that has been a quality in man since the Neolithic times of the cave artist and still finds expression through the subconscious outlines of the phone-pad doodler.</p><h2>Mastering Mathematics Grade 7 Math Teacher&#39;s Manual Part 1</h2><p>Mastering Mathematics Grade 7 Math Teacher&#39;s Manual Part 1</p><p></p><h2>Cervantes: Exemplary Stories (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Composed throughout Cervantes&#39;s writing life and mentioned in Don Quixote, his Exemplary Stories are among the first and finest Spanish short stories: ranging from traditional tales of love to incisive moral fables. In The Little Gipsy Girl, an Italianate romance, the nomadic life is idealised through a love affair between the beautiful Preciosa and a nobleman who agrees to live as a gipsy to win her heart. Elsewhere, the intricacies of love are further explored in tales such as The Jealous Extremaduran, while the picaresque Rinconette and Cortadillo, depicting the friendship between a card-sharper and a pickpocket, presents a very different insight into the lower classes of seventeenth-century Spain.

The front door is black, with a carved fan decoration above it, and there are three windows with the shutters nailed to the facade, on the off chance that some modest European might have the impulse to shut them at night.<br><br>But there's no danger of that now. The Europeans don't live here anymore.<br><br>In 1994 and 1995, I lived here with my wife, Ortensia, and my son, Antonio, aged two. I was the only foreign correspondent for a brand-new Italian newspaper, La Voce, and I was based in Washington, DC. My official title was "bureau chief," but to be honest, there was no bureau. I worked from home in Georgetown. It was a gracious part of America, full of talkative ladies and hyperactive dogs. Bill Clinton was in the White House-Monica Lewinsky, too, as it turned out-but politics was not the first topic of conversation. My neighbors talked mostly about the renovation of Volta Park and told me how to maintain tree boxes properly-they suspected that, as a newcomer, I'd be inattentive and possibly sloppy.<br><br>We left one morning in May 1995, after holding a yard sale that amused the neighbors and loading a moving truck that angered the wife of the senator from Montana. ("Move that truck! I'm married to the senator from Montana!") The truck carried away what was left of our furnishings, to be packed into a wooden crate and shipped to our house in Crema, Italy. Once it had been emptied and painted green, ventilated with a door and windows, and roofed with terra-cotta tiles, the crate went to live at the far end of the backyard, in the shade of the oak and the plane trees. A perfect playhouse.<br><br>But the two-year-old boy has now turned twenty; he'd be embarrassed to take his girlfriend into the playhouse, even if we, his parents, would find it romantic. The crate from our move back is baked by sun and drenched by rain. I tell Antonio these things, but he ignores me. He's looking at the American house where he was a toddler, amused rather than moved. "I remembered it as being bigger," he says, forgetting that back then he was smaller.<br><br>An evening in June, green leaves and blue sky: this time of year, Georgetown is at its best. We try to reenact a photograph snapped right here in 1995, on the sidewalk in front of the house: Pap&#x2c6; kneeling, Antonio standing with a soccer ball in his hands. The difference is that, back then, even on my knees, I was still taller than he was; now I'm hip-high next to him. The new owners, Griff and Kathleen Jenkins, watch us with smiles on their faces. Griff busies himself with a pair of shears, enthusiastically trimming up and down the street, to make sure that no branches interfere with the Italians' photography.<br><br>We've become friends over the years. The Jenkins family-father, mother, two teenage girls-cheerfully tolerated the stream of readers who came to see the house they'd read about. To reassure visitors they had the right place, and dissuade them from ringing the doorbell, they fastened a small bronze plaque to the door, engraved with the title of the book that tells the story of our lives behind those windows: Ciao, America!: An Italian Discovers the U.S.<br><br>Antonio laughs. "Congratulations! I thought you had to be dead to get a bronze plaque."<br><br>The white wooden house on Thirty-fourth Street NW-a one-way street running downhill, then and now-has been renovated, but not beyond recognition. The ground floor, where we played soccer on the hardwood floors, using the fireplace as our goalpost, is still bright and sunny. The downstairs, with the kitchen and dining room, still resembles a fallout shelter: badly lit, sparsely furnished. We step out the back door into the yard. Everything looks familiar. The tree with white blossoms is where it ought to be, the magnolia still showers leaves into the neighbors' yard, and the cement cherub is still making his way through the rosebushes. It did its best-of that I feel sure-but in twenty years it still hasn't managed to become an antique. Older, perhaps, but not necessarily wiser. Much like us, much like America, which it's now time for us to go check up on. The plan is to travel from Washington, DC, to Washington State, by the southern route. By train, though not without variations. An American curve five thousand miles long, running through Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Flagstaff, Tucson, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Destination: Seattle. A trip with my son, to discover the joy of letting him make the decisions. He always has, truth be told, but now it's official. Because there's no two ways about it: Antonio knows what he wants. For instance, here's one condition he insisted on: we have to spend at least two days in Washington, DC, at a certain hotel near Dupont Circle. Ostensibly, to recover from his transatlantic flight and jet lag. Actually, though, because he wants to eat breakfast in the room, and he knows that he can forget about that luxury on an Amtrak train.<br><br>Washington, DC, is a green, geometric misunderstanding that brings together American and foreign tourists. Fifteen million of them every year. They arrive expecting to find a monumental, transitory, artificial city, built by politicians for politics, cut off from the rest of the country. Which is nonsense. Washington, DC, is more representative of America than New York or Los Angeles, which are both unique and irreproducible. There�s only one White House, but there are lots and lots of white houses just like ours. They�re as lively as they are numerous. To a fault, in some cases.<br><br>Washington is a mixed-up, fanciful city, muggy in the summer, freezing in the winter, magical in springtime, brisk in the fall. A strange city: a center of power that has very little of its own. The city is not represented in Congress, which irritates the residents, seeing that they pay taxes, like all other Americans. The license plates carry the somewhat contentious motto "Taxation without representation," a variation on the slogan of the American Revolution ("No taxation without representation"). The colonists, in the middle of the eighteenth century, were protesting the fact that they were obliged to pay taxes to London but had no say in parliamentary decisions. The residents at the turn of the twenty-first century are objecting because they are obliged to pay federal taxes, and they have no say in Congress. Washington is a border city: it's the South of the North, and the North of the South. A city where whites are in the minority, where plants grow luxuriantly, and where many houses have a porch. The classic WPA guides-a series of guidebooks to the American states, published between 1937 and 1945, under the auspices of the Federal Writers' Project-informed visitors: "Everywhere in the Capital one hears the indolent cadence of Southern speech, and encounters that admirable though often irritating Southern characteristic-the innate aversion to hurry and worry."<br><br>Well, that's not the way it is anymore. For many years now, the nation's capital has been an anxious, brusque, and formal place, like the rest of America's cities when it comes to work. Even on a day like today. The heat is ferocious, the humidity oppressive. Antonio looks at me and says nothing, but he drags his feet as if to ask, "Where on earth have you brought me?" Beneath a sky the color of dirty glass, men in ties and women in skirt suits dart back and forth like pinballs: they're trying to run up as many points as they can before vanishing into some quiet building. Ideally, with air-conditioning, something pinball machines don't have.<br><br>Driven by a combination of suffocation and civic duty, we visit the Newseum, where America tells its story as it likes to hear it: heroic and true to its values, with the occasional touch of enthusiastic madness. We walk past FBI headquarters. To decorate the temporary wooden barriers around the renovation work, they're using famous sayings of the presidents: in chronological order, playing no favorites. We climb up to Capitol Hill, we walk down to the Mall, and, exhausted, we suddenly remember what we ought to have known, since we've lived here before: in America no one goes for a stroll; they go somewhere and come back.<br><br>We hide out at Charlie Palmer's, a steak house that's popular with members of Congress. An austere place that could be mistaken for a hospital if it weren't for the color: mahogany instead of pale green. Antonio-sweat drenched, sleepy, and argumentative-wants a hamburger with fries. The uniformed headwaiter looks down his nose at him, the way a Venetian gondolier might look at a Realtor from Richmond, Virginia, as he snaps pictures on the Grand Canal. I look at the headwaiter. I explain to him that, in any tussle with the appetite of a jet-lagged twenty-year-old, he's bound to lose. He smiles and comes back with the hamburger.<br><br>We grab a taxi, we head for Dupont Circle, and we get stuck in traffic caused by the Pride Parade. The situation meets with the Somali taxi driver's disapproval, and he breaks off the intense conversation he's carrying on over his cell phone to curse the parade in an unidentifiable language. Antonio, suddenly wide-awake, starts asking me a series of difficult questions.<br><br>"Why are the streets full of half-naked people, but it's considered scandalous to show a breast on television? Do you remember that time at the Super Bowl?"<br><br>"What does Dykes on Bikes mean?"<br><br>"Why is DC Eagle wearing nothing but a black leather miniskirt?"<br><br>"Why is that priest in the march?"<br><br>And then, back at the hotel:<br><br>"Why did that guy in thermal underwear on the elevator offer us free condoms, but I'm still not old enough to order a beer?"<br><br>Coward that I am, I suggest he ask the coffee shop waitress, who looks to be about his age; but Antonio, lying in his turn, claims that his English isn't up to the task. But the young woman is talkative. She tells us that the Gay Pride Parade snarls traffic and brings in plenty of customers; her salary basically goes to pay taxes, seven hundred dollars every two weeks. She makes her money off tips. With foreigners, it's best to be direct, she tells us; they don't always know it's customary to leave a tip, and if the tip is generous, all the better. She doesn't seem particularly interested in the world around her, nor do the Americans in the restaurant seem particularly interested in her.<br><br>We leave, go into Kramerbooks to buy a Rand McNally road atlas, then walk down Sixteenth Street-the street that once separated the world of the whites from everyone else-to Pennsylvania Avenue. Outdoor caf tables, bicycles leaning against walls, people chatting. Washington, DC, seems to have figured out what it had forgotten twenty years ago: there's no law against slowing down, no regulation forbidding you to stop and chat with your friends on the street.<br><br>Union Station has changed since 1995. The American love of strict procedure hasn�t, though. We all have to wait in one place; we all have to enter the gate at the same time, then wait our turn to be taken to the faraway track in an electric vehicle. The driver, dressed in a scarlet uniform-age impossible to guess, and with an inexplicable enthusiasm-drives and shouts as if he were competing in a rodeo. He drops us off at Track J25, train no. 19, destination New Orleans. He wishes us happy travels, eager to reprise his show for the next passengers. We take possession of our compartment, which is a concentrate of American mechanical fantasies: a sink that folds away and becomes a step, for instance. We need to find a place to put everything. We�ll be spending a little more than twenty-four hours in this compartment, but we can�t spend that time with the wheels of our roller suitcases on our necks. I show Antonio my copy of Travels with Charley, by John Steinbeck, which I brought with me from Italy. I open the book, find the page, and read aloud:<br><br>When I laid the ground plan of my journey, there were definite questions to which I wanted matching answers. It didn't seem to me that they were impossible questions. I suppose they could all be lumped into the single question: "What are Americans like today?"<br><br>Antonio replies: "Well, they're shorter than we are, that's for sure. At least, the ones who travel by train must be, because I'm too tall to fit in this bunk." <br><br>"Any other comments?" I ask. <br><br>He looks at the cover of the book. "Your author traveled with a dog, who barked or wagged his tail to make himself understood. I am your son, and I'd like to inform you that you're sitting on my backpack."<br><br>I have a suspicion that the boy's not going to read the book, but he's already commented on it. When he grows up, he could be a book critic. Time to go.<br><br>Night Train for New Orleans<br><br>Our train is called the Crescent, and it left Manhattan's Penn Station at 2:15 in the afternoon. It stopped, ninety-one miles later, in Philadelphia; it pulled out again at 3:55. Ninety-four miles later it arrived in Baltimore, which it left at 5:14 p.m. After forty miles it pulled into Union Station in Washington, DC, and left again at 6:30, with two Italians aboard. An older one, euphoric. And a younger one, puzzled.<br><br>The train is supposed to reach Charlotte, North Carolina, tonight at 2:20 a.m. Atlanta, Georgia, tomorrow morning at 8:13. Birmingham, Alabama, at 10:23. And then, finally, New Orleans. Arrival scheduled at 7:32 p.m., 1,377 miles from its starting point. I'm certain of the schedules and the distances because Amtrak has salted the train cars with brochures providing all this information about the trip. The national love of numbers has been satisfied; the love of comfort-another national commandment-a little less so. Amtrak represents the side of America that is practical and unshowy; not the highly efficient, innovative, and aesthetically impeccable America. The only thing our train has in common with an Apple product is the color: the gleaming silver that is reminiscent of Airstream trailers and diner counters. These are places where the nation likes to see its reflection, and remember the way things were. There are three Scenic Highlights touted to the passengers:<br><br>vibrant Northeast cityscapes (that is, the train is going to run through the ramshackle outskirts of several large cities)</p><h2>Icons of Photography: The 20th Century</h2><p>Ninety seminal images by the world&#39;s greatest artists provide a stunning tour of the twentieth-century&#39;s greatest photographs.

She believes a handful of soil from her grandmother's ancestral home in Jerusalem will save her beloved Sitti Zeynab's life. The only problem is that Hayaat and her family live behind the impenetrable wall that divides the West Bank, and they're on the wrong side of check points, curfews, and the travel permit system. Plus, Hayaat's best friend Samy always manages to attract trouble. But luck is on the pair's side as they undertake the journey to Jerusalem from the Palestinian Territories when Hayaat and Samy have a curfew-free day to travel.</p><p>Randa Abdel-Fattah is an attorney, a writer, a chocoholic, and an active member in the interfaith community, as well as the campaign for Palestinian human rights. She is the author of the critically acclaimed novels DOES MY HEAD LOOK BIG IN THIS? and TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT ME, both published by Orchard Books. She is also the author of the forthcoming middle-grade novel, WHERE THE STREETS HAD A NAME, published by Scholastic Press. Ms. Abdel-Fattah lives in Sydney, Australia, with her husband and their children.Hayaat, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl, has a disfiguring scar from an incident of violence that killed her best friend. Her family tries to make sense out of the chaos they live in, suffering heartache yet clinging to hope. Narrator Kellie Jones never allows bitterness toward Israelis to creep into Hayaat&#39;s tone, instead presenting a bright youngster with an adventurous, indomitable spirit. This audiobook begins with a glossary of Palestinian terms. Unfortunately, presenting a glossary at the beginning of a listening experience is both distracting and inconvenient, particularly for young listeners. Without context clues, by the time the terms appear in the story, the listener has likely forgotten their meaning. It&#39;s too bad because, otherwise, Jones does a fine narration of an underexplored subject: the problems faced by Palestinian families living in occupied territory.

In 1945, he was a U.S. Army private stationed with Eisenhower's forces in Germany. Himself a Jew, Hilliard was a horrified witness to the way concentration camp survivors were treated in camps now administered by U.S. troops and, with another private, wrote and distributed to Americans back home a document testifying to what he saw. According to the author, the survivors were subjected to anti-Semitism expressed by army officers as well as illness and starvation, because the rations and medicine allotted to them were stolen and sold on the black market. Hilliard also charges that former Nazis were permitted to head civilian governments and that they harassed Jewish refugees who came into their towns. Included are vivid descriptions of St. Ottilien, a hospital set up near Landsberg in Germany for survivors by survivors, where the only food available was smuggled in by sympathetic soldiers.

As newly freed African Americans from the South poured in, free blacks outnumbered slaves for the first time. Radical notions of abolishing slavery circulated on the city's streets, and white residents were forced to confront new ideas of what the nation's future might look like.<br><br>On the night of August 4th, Arthur Bowen, an eighteen-year-old slave, stumbled into the bedroom where his owner, Anna Thornton, slept. He had an ax in the crook of his arm. An alarm was raised, and he ran away. Word of the incident spread rapidly, and within days, Washington's first race riot exploded, as whites fearing a slave rebellion attacked the property of the free blacks. Residents dubbed the event the &#x201c;Snow-Storm," in reference to the central role of Beverly Snow, a flamboyant former slave turned successful restaurateur, who became the target of the mob's rage.<br><br>In the wake of the riot came two sensational criminal trials that gripped the city. Prosecuting both cases was none other than Francis Scott Key, a politically ambitious attorney famous for writing the lyrics to &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner,&#x201d; who few now remember served as the city's district attorney for eight years. Key defended slavery until the twilight's last gleaming, and pandered to racial fears by seeking capital punishment for Arthur Bowen. But in a surprise twist his prosecution was thwarted by Arthur's ostensible victim, Anna Thornton, a respected socialite who sought the help of President Andrew Jackson.<br><br>Ranging beyond the familiar confines of the White House and the Capitol, <i>Snow-Storm in August</i>&nbsp;delivers readers into an unknown chapter of American history with a textured and absorbing account of the racial secrets and contradictions that coursed beneath the freewheeling capital of a rising world power.<br><br><b>"<i>Snow-Storm in August</i> is the sort of book I most love to read: history so fresh it feels alive, yet&nbsp;introducing me to&nbsp;a&nbsp;time and place that I had&nbsp;little known or utterly misunderstood.

His first book was <i>Our Man in Mexico: Winston Scott and the Hidden History of the CIA.&nbsp;</i><i>Excerpted from Chapter One<br><br></i>Beverly Snow did not look like trouble, not hardly. He was a mild--mannered fellow of mixed--race heritage&#x2014;-in the lingo of the day, a mulatto. The admixture of African and European blood in his veins gave an air of incongruous humor to his countenance. His language was learned, if a little extravagant, for he knew his way around a kitchen and loved to pass cooking time in conversation. To the patrons, white and colored alike, who gathered at his oyster house in the tobacco town of Lynchburg, Virginia, Beverly held forth more as a Creole raconteur than discontented bondsman. In the autumn of 1829, he was certainly better known for his way with words and white men than for any sort of difficulty. He humored the hungry with a steady stream of jokes and japes while doling out fat James River oysters and dispensing a variety of sage epigrams, dubious puns, and enigmatic epiphanies at no extra charge. The fare was salubrious, the conversation light, the prices lighter. That was Beverly&#x2019;s way.<br><br>While it was true that not all white men approved of a colored man doing business in the heart of town, it was more true that Beverly&#x2019;s friends, John and Susannah Warwick, approved of his enterprise. In Lynchburg that was enough. John was the son of Major William Warwick, a Revolutionary War veteran turned banker who had served as the first mayor of the settlement around John Lynch&#x2019;s ferry landing back in 1805. Susannah was the daughter of Captain William Norvell, a veteran of Valley Forge and the village&#x2019;s first clerk. John and Susannah Warwick owned Beverly Snow, but ownership hardly described Susannah&#x2019;s relationship to him. Beverly was also her friend, almost a big brother.<br><br>Beverly had lived for at least a few years in Captain Norvell&#x2019;s mansion on Federal Hill, the most distinguished enclave in the growing town. Nothing is known of Beverly&#x2019;s parents other than that one of them, probably his father, was white. Unusually for an enslaved person, Beverly learned to read and write at an early age, perhaps because Captain Norvell had helped establish the first public school in Lynchburg. Along the way, Beverly might have glimpsed one of the great men of the day, former president Thomas Jefferson, who sold a plot of land to William Norvell in 1812. Legend has it that Jefferson visited their house. Beverly, as a servant and cook, might have prepared his meals, perhaps even overheard his conversation. The servant and the statesman would come to share at least one pastime. Jefferson often digressed on his admiration for Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher who espoused a creed of pleasurable moderation in the third century before Christ. Before long, Beverly Snow would do the same.<br><br>Susannah Norvell, five years younger than Beverly, came of age eating his food and laughing at his jokes. A sensitive dark--haired beauty, she married John Marshall Warwick, the son of her father&#x2019;s friend, when she was seventeen years old. She endowed her husband&#x2019;s mustachioed placidity with the drive of self--improvement, and the young couple flourished. John Warwick had worked in the family dry-goods business since boyhood. As early as 1816, his name appeared on a bill of sale to Jefferson. At age twenty--one John obtained his merchant&#x2019;s license and turned his attention to tobacco, the cash crop of the hilly counties surrounding Lynchburg. The leafy plant was grown in abandon, bundled into fifteen--hundred--pound hogsheads, inspected, and sold to traders who shipped the leaf to Europe, where segars and pipe smoking were all the rage. Enslaved Africans did most of the work to create this pleasure. White men reaped all of the profits. John Warwick did better than most. He was a rich man well before his thirtieth birthday. His wife had a harder time. Susannah Warwick gave birth to four children, three of whom died before the age of three. In her sorrow, she liked to write and dream of a better world. She loathed the institution of slavery and was unafraid to say so. &#x201c;It is a stain upon the character of Virginians,&#x201d; she wrote in her journal, &#x201c;and one which I hope will not long remain.&#x201d;<br><br>In 1824, Susannah&#x2019;s father prepared his will. At the time, Captain Norvell owned several Negro families, including twenty--six people. He granted each of his six children the right to take possession of any two. Susannah chose Beverly. By the next year, he had moved in with the Warwicks. In 1826, the couple announced their success to Lynchburg society by building a Federal--style brick house on Court Street along the high bluff overlooking the James River. Beverly perfected his cooking skills in the basement kitchen. He also took a wife, a soon--to--be--free colored girl six years his junior who was known to white people as Judy. She called herself Julia.<br><br>Beverly and Julia Snow lived in the same house as John and Susannah Warwick, sharing something of their prosperity and of their sadness. Beverly saw how John coped with the loss of his babies: by serving others. When Lynchburg formed its first board of health in 1828, John became a member. Eventually, John Warwick, like his father, would become the mayor of Lynchburg. With John and Susannah&#x2019;s support, Beverly and Judy opened the oyster house on Lynch Street to serve customers and workers at John&#x2019;s nearby tobacco warehouse and others who thronged the busy wharf. It was the kind of informal agreement between owners and bondsmen not unknown in well--established families in Virginia. Beverly, while still the property of his mistress, had permission to keep at least some of the money his customers handed over.<br><br>Beverly&#x2019;s wit soon set the people of Lynchburg to laughing. One tale concerned the Cargills, a strolling family theatrical company that had arrived in 1828. Beverly was not alone in admiring their considerable style. The Cargills arrived in carriages and buggies, while their wardrobes came in baggage wagons. As stage performers, the Cargills were truly distinguished, the locals agreed, not at all resembling the disreputable Crummieses, the acting family lampooned in Charles Dickens&#x2019;s just--published novel Nicholas Nickleby. Mr. Cargill was a gentleman, and Mrs. Cargill was ladylike and educated. Their daughter, the beautiful Mary, was comely, beloved, and respected. They delighted the town with their comic and tragic performances for much of a year.<br><br>Then one morning, Lynchburg awoke to find the Cargills had vanished. The stunned townspeople discovered they would have to pay for their happy suspension of belief about the Cargills&#x2019; dramatis personae. The strolling actors had strolled off without a nod to friends or creditors. The young studs who lamented the loss of the phenomenal Mary did not suffer long. But the Cargills&#x2019; many business associates did. Those who had provided food and drink, bed and board to these consummate actors could only shake their unpaid bills in impotent fury. When one man wondered aloud how the spendthrift thespians had escaped, Beverly nodded toward the James River.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe, sir,&#x201d; he sighed, &#x201c;that the play--actors have concluded to glide smoothly down the stream,&#x201d; which was certainly one of the greatest euphemisms ever uttered in Lynchburg.<br>Beverly Snow tasted politics in the summer of 1828 when Secretary of State Henry Clay came to Lynchburg. John Warwick formed a welcoming committee to hail the Kentucky statesman who would pursue the presidency of the United States of America without success for the next three decades. John supported Clay&#x2019;s &#x201c;American System,&#x201d; in which the national government in Washington would use tax and tariff revenues to build roads and canals and make other internal improvements that would enable the people of the young republic to wrest a living from the virgin forests and rolling plains once occupied by the native Indians. To many Lynchburg merchants, Henry Clay&#x2019;s plan was common sense. New roads and canals would fortify the town&#x2019;s position as a commercial center between the eastern seaboard and the western frontier.<br><br>Beverly Snow, it is safe to say, was less enamored of the slick operator some called &#x201c;Harry of the West.&#x201d; When it came to people of color, Clay was a supporter of African colonization. This was a popular scheme of the day that proposed to end the blight of chattel slavery in the United States of America by freeing the enslaved and sending them to settle the western coast of Africa. While the supporters of colonization prided themselves on their humanitarianism toward Negroes, theirs was a benevolence wrapped in a prejudice that Henry Clay voiced as well as any man. Clay especially reviled those Africans in America who had managed to gain their legal freedom. &#x201c;Of all classes of our population, the most vicious is that of the free colored,&#x201d; Clay liked to say. &#x201c;Contaminated themselves, they extend their vices to all around them.&#x201d;<br><br>Beverly had no use for such insults. He planned to obtain his freedom within two years and he had other destinations in mind besides Africa. Despite the practice of slavery and the common condescension articulated by the likes of Clay, Beverly was not eager to leave the country where he was born. Truth be told, he often enjoyed life in these United States. In central Virginia, the families of slaves and masters had been intertwined for generations. Countless children of African and European blood, like Susannah Norvell and Beverly Snow, had grown up as siblings, playmates, friends, rivals, and every other human bond. By the early 1800s, the bonds of decency and familiarity, combined with the revolutionary ideology of the War for Independence, had prompted a growing number of white men to let their bondsmen buy their freedom. Some whites freed their slaves in their wills. Others promised freedom to their children. Those were the terms that Beverly had been born into: with a promise of manumission when he reached the age of thirty.<br><br>Beverly Snow embodied the reality of America&#x2019;s race--mixing ways. While the &#x201c;amalgamation&#x201d; of whites and blacks was often abhorred, it was also indulged. To cite but one common practice among white people, most white mothers preferred African women to Irish women as wet nurses for their children, finding them altogether more agreeable, affectionate, and trustworthy than their Hibernian counterparts. White men, alas, had baser impulses. They wanted women of color as mistresses, concubines, whores, and occasionally as wives. Beverly, along with plenty of other people, knew the story of Richard Mentor Johnson, a famous Indian fighter turned U.S. senator from Kentucky. Johnson lived openly with a mulatto woman named Julia Chinn, who bore him two daughters of whom he was quite proud. Johnson offended the finer ladies of Frankfort, Kentucky&#x2014;-and made news nationally&#x2014;-by attempting to introduce the two girls at a Fourth of July cotillion in 1828. They were rejected by the other white mothers over Johnson&#x2019;s indignant protests. When Chinn died, Johnson took up with another enslaved African woman named Parthene. While scandalous to the moralists of press and pulpit, Johnson&#x2019;s domestic arrangements did not impede the upward arc of his political career. And colored men wanted white women. They risked brutal punishment or death for observing, much less sampling, the charms of white women, which didn&#x2019;t mean that more than a few black fools didn&#x2019;t try. Among the lowest classes of whites, some women were notorious for favoring Africans as lovers. The less scrupulous among them used their wiles to extract money favors from the duller Negroes. Even the white man&#x2019;s most savage treatment of these aspiring Othellos&#x2014;-and the white woman&#x2019;s shaming of their sisterly Desdemonas&#x2014;-could not extirpate such forbidden desires. Coupling and procreating had a stubborn pride that disregarded taboo and teaching. It was natural that Beverly Snow&#x2019;s mother had named him after a white man, Beverley Randolph, who had served as Virginia&#x2019;s eighth governor in 1788. By heritage and upbringing, Beverly lived in a racially mixed society that pretended it was anything but.<br><br>The question facing Beverly in 1829 was whether he should stick around Lynchburg or seek his fortune elsewhere. Beverly needed no reminder that his thirtieth birthday was approaching. If the good news was that he would soon be free, the bad news was that the Commonwealth of Virginia required his removal. According to an 1806 statute, any enslaved person of African descent who obtained his or her freedom had to leave the state within a year or else &#x201c;be apprehended and sold&#x201d; back into slavery. Beverly could remain in Lynchburg only if a white man petitioned the state legislature for permission. With an owner as friendly as Susannah Warwick, Beverly might have been able to stay if he wanted. Instead he made plans to depart.<br><br>Lynchburg had little to offer a free man of color. The slave traders supplying the tobacco planters with coerced Negro laborers dominated the town&#x2019;s life. A carpenter from the area named Pleasant Roane summed up the appalling difficulties he faced at that time. The free black man, Roane said, was &#x201c;denied the use and enjoyment of many of the most valuable rights and privileges of freemen [and] subjected in all cases of offences to the most vigorous exactions of penal law.&#x201d; As a result, he added, most free blacks sank into &#x201c;a state of contempt and degradation.&#x201d;<br><br>Beverly figured Washington City could not treat him worse than that. The capital lay in the District of Columbia, located 180 miles northeast of Lynchburg, a ride of several days by coach. Such proximity generated some awareness of its attractions and dangers. Yes, the capital city was known as a perennially indebted municipality of dubious morals. Yes, its haphazard streets and well--hidden charms evoked laughter among European tourists and Virginia squires alike. And yes, there were stories of free colored men who had visited the capital of liberty only to be kidnapped and sold into slavery. But the capital was changing. In the recent presidential election, General Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815, had won more votes than incumbent John Quincy Adams. The first westerner elected to the presidency, Jackson was inaugurated in March 1829 before a vast and adoring crowd. If nothing else, Beverly and Julia could live and work there legally. The capital beckoned not as a promised land but as a refuge, a haven where a colored man just might have room enough to prove himself.<br><br>In November 1829, Beverly&#x2019;s day came. Susannah Norvell Warwick did her part to end the stain of slavery on herself and her state by agreeing to manumit her bondsman. Beverly and her husband walked two blocks to the Lynchburg courthouse, where John handed the justice of the peace a handwritten deed of freedom. The justice of the peace copied its standard language into a big bound volume. In exchange for five dollars, John Warwick attested that he did &#x201c;emancipate, set free, and relinquish all Manner of right to the personal Services of my man Slave Beverly, commonly called Beverly Snow.&#x201d;<br><br>John Warwick signed the deed and set his seal in red wax. Snow walked out onto Court Street a free American.</p><h2>Dead Until Dark (Southern Vampire Mysteries, No. 1)</h2><p><p><b>Visit our Sookie Stackhouse series feature page</b>.</p>For years, Charlaine Harris has delighted fans with her mystery series featuring small-town waitress-turned-paranormal sleuth Sookie Stackhouse.

She enjoys the movies, fast-pitch softball, and (above all) reading.1<br>I&#x2019;d been waiting for the vampire for years when he walked into the bar.<br><br>Ever since vampires came out of the coffin (as they laughingly put it) four years ago, I&#x2019;d hoped one would come to Bon Temps. We had all the other minorities in our little town&#x2014;why not the newest, the legally recognized undead? But rural northern Louisiana wasn&#x2019;t too tempting to vampires, apparently; on the other hand, New Orleans was a real center for them&#x2014;the whole Anne Rice thing, right?<br><br>It&#x2019;s not that long a drive from Bon Temps to New Orleans, and everyone who came into the bar said that if you threw a rock on a street corner you&#x2019;d hit one. Though you better not.<br><br>But I was waiting for my own vampire.<br><br>You can tell I don&#x2019;t get out much. And it&#x2019;s not because I&#x2019;m not pretty. I am. I&#x2019;m blond and blue-eyed and twenty-five, and my legs are strong and my bosom is substantial, and I have a waspy waistline. I look good in the warm-weather waitress outfit Sam picked for us: black shorts, white T, white socks, black Nikes.<br><br>But I have a disability. That&#x2019;s how I try to think of it.<br><br>The bar patrons just say I&#x2019;m crazy.<br><br>Either way, the result is that I almost never have a date. So little treats count a lot with me.<br><br>And he sat at one of my tables&#x2014;the vampire.<br><br>I knew immediately what he was. It amazed me when no one else turned around to stare. They couldn&#x2019;t tell! But to me, his skin had a little glow, and I just knew.<br><br>I could have danced with joy, and in fact I did do a little step right there by the bar. Sam Merlotte, my boss, looked up from the drink he was mixing and gave me a tiny smile. I grabbed my tray and pad and went over to the vampire&#x2019;s table. I hoped that my lipstick was still even and my ponytail was still neat. I&#x2019;m kind of tense, and I could feel my smile yanking the corners of my mouth up.<br><br>He seemed lost in thought, and I had a chance to give him a good once-over before he looked up. He was a little under six feet, I estimated. He had thick brown hair, combed straight back and brushing his collar, and his long sideburns seemed curiously old-fashioned. He was pale, of course; hey, he was dead, if you believed the old tales. The politically correct theory, the one the vamps themselves publicly backed, had it that this guy was the victim of a virus that left him apparently dead for a couple of days and thereafter allergic to sunlight, silver, and garlic. The details depended on which newspaper you read. They were all full of vampire stuff these days.<br><br>Anyway, his lips were lovely, sharply sculpted, and he had arched dark brows. His nose swooped down right out of that arch, like a prince&#x2019;s in a Byzantine mosaic. When he finally looked up, I saw his eyes were even darker than his hair, and the whites were incredibly white.<br><br>``What can I get you?&#x201d; I asked, happy almost beyond words.<br><br>He raised his eyebrows. ``Do you have the bottled synthetic blood?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>``No, I&#x2019;m so sorry! Sam&#x2019;s got some on order. Should be in next week.&#x201d;<br><br>``Then red wine, please,&#x201d; he said, and his voice was cool and clear, like a stream over smooth stones. I laughed out loud. It was too perfect.<br><br>``Don&#x2019;t mind, Sookie, mister, she&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; came a familiar voice from the booth against the wall. All my happiness deflated, though I could feel the smile still straining my lips. The vampire was staring at me, watching the life go out of my face.<br><br>``I&#x2019;ll get your wine right away,&#x201d; I said, and strode off, not even looking at Mack Rattray&#x2019;s smug face. He was there almost every night, he and his wife Denise. I called them the Rat Couple. They&#x2019;d done their best to make me miserable since they&#x2019;d moved into the rent trailer at Four Tracks Corner. I had hoped that they&#x2019;d blow out of Bon Temps as suddenly as they&#x2019;d blown in.<br><br>When they&#x2019;d first come into Merlotte&#x2019;s, I&#x2019;d very rudely listened in to their thoughts&#x2014;I know, pretty low-class of me. But I get bored like everyone else, and though I spend most of my time blocking out the thoughts of other people that try to pass through my brain, sometimes I just give in. So I knew some things about the Rattrays that maybe no one else did. For one thing, I knew they&#x2019;d been in jail, though I didn&#x2019;t know why. For another, I&#x2019;d read the nasty thoughts Mack Rattray had entertained about yours truly. And then I&#x2019;d heard in Denise&#x2019;s thoughts that she&#x2019;d abandoned a baby she&#x2019;d had two years before, a baby that wasn&#x2019;t Mack&#x2019;s.<br><br>And they didn&#x2019;t tip, either.<br><br>Sam poured a glass of the house red wine, looking over at the vampire&#x2019;s table as he put it on my tray.<br><br>When Sam looked back at me, I could tell he too knew our new customer was undead. Sam&#x2019;s eyes are Paul Newman blue, as opposed to my own hazy blue gray. Sam is blond, too, but his hair is wiry and his blond is almost a sort of hot red gold. He is always a little sunburned, and though he looks slight in his clothes, I have seen him unload trucks with his shirt off, and he has plenty of upper body strength. I never listen to Sam&#x2019;s thoughts. He&#x2019;s my boss. I&#x2019;ve had to quit jobs before because I found out things I didn&#x2019;t want to know about my boss.<br><br>But Sam didn&#x2019;t comment, he just gave me the wine. I checked the glass to make sure it was sparkly clean and made my way back to the vampire&#x2019;s table.<br><br>``Your wine, sir,&#x201d; I said ceremoniously and placed it carefully on the table exactly in front of him. He looked at me again, and I stared into his lovely eyes while I had the chance. ``Enjoy,&#x201d; I said proudly. Behind me, Mack Rattray yelled, ``Hey, Sookie! We need another pitcher of beer here!&#x201d; I sighed and turned to take the empty pitcher from the Rats&#x2019; table. Denise was in fine form tonight, I noticed, wearing a halter top and short shorts, her mess of brown hair floofing around her head in fashionable tangles. Denise wasn&#x2019;t truly pretty, but she was so flashy and confident that it took awhile to figure that out.<br><br>A little while later, to my dismay, I saw the Rattrays had moved over to the vampire&#x2019;s table. They were talking at him. I couldn&#x2019;t see that he was responding a lot, but he wasn&#x2019;t leaving either.<br><br>``Look at that!&#x201d; I said disgustedly to Arlene, my fellow waitress. Arlene is redheaded and freckled and ten years older than me, and she&#x2019;s been married four times. She has two kids, and from time to time, I think she considers me her third.<br><br>``New guy, huh?&#x201d; she said with small interest. Arlene is currently dating Rene Lenier, and though I can&#x2019;t see the attraction, she seems pretty satisfied. I think Rene was her second husband.<br><br>``Oh, he&#x2019;s a vampire,&#x201d; I said, just having to share my delight with someone.<br><br>``Really? Here? Well, just think,&#x201d; she said, smiling a little to show she appreciated my pleasure. ``He can&#x2019;t be too bright, though, honey, if he&#x2019;s with the Rats. On the other hand, Denise is giving him quite a show.&#x201d;<br><br>I figured it out after Arlene made it plain to me; she&#x2019;s much better at sizing up sexual situations than I am due to her experience and my lack.<br><br>The vampire was hungry. I&#x2019;d always heard that the synthetic blood the Japanese had developed kept vampires up to par as far as nutrition, but didn&#x2019;t really satisfy their hunger, which was why there were ``Unfortunate Incidents&#x201d; from time to time. (That was the vampire euphemism for the bloody slaying of a human.) And here was Denise Rattray, stroking her throat, turning her neck from side to side...what a bitch.<br><br>My brother, Jason, came into the bar, then, and sauntered over to give me a hug. He knows that women like a man who&#x2019;s good to his family and also kind to the disabled, so hugging me is a double whammy of recommendation. Not that Jason needs many more points than he has just by being himself. He&#x2019;s handsome. He can sure be mean, too, but most women seem quite willing to overlook that.<br><br>``Hey, sis, how&#x2019;s Gran?&#x201d;<br><br>``She&#x2019;s okay, about the same. Come by to see.&#x201d;<br><br>``I will. Who&#x2019;s loose tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>``Look for yourself.&#x201d; I noticed that when Jason began to glance around there was a flutter of female hands to hair, blouses, lips.<br><br>``Hey. I see DeeAnne. She free?&#x201d;<br><br>``She&#x2019;s here with a trucker from Hammond. He&#x2019;s in the bathroom. Watch it.&#x201d;<br><br>Jason grinned at me, and I marvelled that other women could not see the selfishness of that smile. Even Arlene tucked in her T-shirt when Jason came in, and after four husbands she should have known a little about evaluating men. The other waitress I worked with, Dawn, tossed her hair and straightened her back to make her boobs stand out. Jason gave her an amiable wave. She pretended to sneer. She&#x2019;s on the outs with Jason, but she still wants him to notice her.<br><br>I got really busy&#x2014;everyone came to Merlotte&#x2019;s on Saturday night for some portion of the evening&#x2014;so I lost track of my vampire for a while. When I next had a moment to check on him, he was talking to Denise. Mack was looking at him with an expression so avid that I became worried.<br><br>I went closer to the table, staring at Mack. Finally, I let down my guard and listened.<br><br>Mack and Denise had been in jail for vampire draining.<br><br>Deeply upset, I nevertheless automatically carried a pitcher of beer and some glasses to a raucous table of four. Since vampire blood was supposed to temporarily relieve symptoms of illness and increase sexual potency, kind of like prednisone and Viagra rolled into one, there was a huge black market for genuine, undiluted vampire blood. Where there&#x2019;s a market there are suppliers; in this case, I&#x2019;d just learned, the scummy Rat Couple. They&#x2019;d formerly trapped vampires and drained them, selling the little vials of blood for as much as $200 apiece. It had been the drug of choice for at least two years now. Some buyers went crazy after drinking pure vampire blood, but that didn&#x2019;t slow the market any.<br><br>The drained vampire didn&#x2019;t last long, as a rule. The drainers left the vampires staked or simply dumped them out in the open. When the sun came up, that was all she wrote. From time to time, you read about the tables being turned when the vampire managed to get free. Then you got your dead drainers.<br><br>Now my vampire was getting up and leaving with the Rats. Mack met my eyes, and I saw him looking distinctly startled at the expression on my face. He turned away, shrugging me off like everyone else.<br><br>That made me mad. Really mad.<br><br>What should I do? While I struggled with myself, they were out the door. Would the vampire believe me if I ran after them, told him? No one else did. Or if by chance they did, they hated and feared me for reading the thoughts concealed in people&#x2019;s brains. Arlene had begged me to read her fourth husband&#x2019;s mind when he&#x2019;d come in to pick her up one night because she was pretty certain he was thinking of leaving her and the kids, but I wouldn&#x2019;t because I wanted to keep the one friend I had. And even Arlene hadn&#x2019;t been able to ask me directly because that would be admitting I had this gift, this curse. People couldn&#x2019;t admit it. They had to think I was crazy. Which sometimes I almost was!<br><br>So I dithered, confused and frightened and angry, and then I knew I just had to act. I was goaded by the look Mack had given me&#x2014;as if I was negligible.<br><br>I slid down the bar to Jason, where he was sweeping DeeAnne off her feet. She didn&#x2019;t take much sweeping, popular opinion had it. The trucker from Hammond was glowering from her other side.<br><br>``Jason,&#x201d; I said urgently. He turned to give me a warning glare. ``Listen, is that chain still in the back of the pickup?&#x201d;<br><br>``Never leave home without it,&#x201d; he said lazily, his eyes scanning my face for signs of trouble. ``You going to fight, Sookie?&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled at him, so used to grinning that it was easy. ``I sure hope not,&#x201d; I said cheerfully.<br><br>``Hey, you need help?&#x201d; After all, he was my brother.<br><br>``No, thanks,&#x201d; I said, trying to sound reassuring. And I slipped over to Arlene. ``Listen, I got to leave a little early. My tables are pretty thin, can you cover for me?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d ever asked Arlene such a thing, though I&#x2019;d covered for her many times. She, too, offered me help. ``That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I said. ``I&#x2019;ll be back in if I can. If you clean my area, I&#x2019;ll do your trailer.&#x201d;<br><br>Arlene nodded her red mane enthusiastically.<br><br>I pointed to the employee door, to myself, and made my fingers walk, to tell Sam where I was going.<br><br>He nodded. He didn&#x2019;t look happy.<br><br>So out the back door I went, trying to make my feet quiet on the gravel. The employee parking lot is at the rear of the bar, through a door leading into the storeroom. The cook&#x2019;s car was there, and Arlene&#x2019;s, Dawn&#x2019;s, and mine. To my right, the east, Sam&#x2019;s pickup was sitting in front of his trailer.<br><br>I went out of the graveled employee parking area onto the blacktop that surfaced the much larger customer lot to the west of the bar. Woods surrounded the clearing in which Merlotte&#x2019;s stood, and the edges of the parking lot were mostly gravel. Sam kept it well lit, and the surrealistic glare of the high, parking lot lights made everything look strange.<br><br>I saw the Rat Couple&#x2019;s dented red sports car, so I knew they were close.<br><br>I found Jason&#x2019;s truck at last. It was black with custom aqua and pink swirls on the sides. He sure did love to be noticed. I pulled myself up by the tailgate and rummaged around in the bed for his chain, a thick length of links that he carried in case of a fight. I looped it and carried it pressed to my body so it wouldn&#x2019;t chink.<br><br>I thought a second. The only halfway private spot to which the Rattrays could have lured the vampire was the end of the parking lot where the trees actually overhung the cars. So I crept in that direction, trying to move fast and low.<br><br>I paused every few seconds and listened. Soon I heard a groan and the faint sounds of voices. I snaked between the cars, and I spotted them right where I&#x2019;d figured they&#x2019;d be. The vampire was down on the ground on his back, his face contorted in agony, and the gleam of chains crisscrossed his wrists and ran down to his ankles. Silver. There were two little vials of blood already on the ground beside Denise&#x2019;s feet, and as I watched, she fixed a new Vacutainer to the needle. The tourniquet above his elbow dug cruelly into his arm.<br><br>Their backs were to me, and the vampire hadn&#x2019;t seen me yet. I loosened the coiled chain so a good three feet of it swung free. Who to attack first? They were both small and vicious.<br><br>I remembered Mack&#x2019;s contemptuous dismissal and the fact that he never left me a tip. Mack first.<br><br>I&#x2019;d never actually been in a fight before. Somehow I was positively looking forward to it.<br><br>I leapt out from behind a pickup and swung the chain. It thwacked across Mack&#x2019;s back as he knelt beside his victim. He screamed and jumped up. After a glance, Denise set about getting the third Vacutainer plugged. Mack&#x2019;s hand dipped down to his boot and came up shining. I gulped. He had a knife in his hand.<br><br>``Uh-oh,&#x201d; I said, and grinned at him.<br><br>``You crazy bitch!&#x201d; he screamed. He sounded like he was looking forward to using the knife. I was too involved to keep my mental guard up, and I had a clear flash of what Mack wanted to do to me. It drove me really crazy. I went for him with every intention of hurting him as badly as I could. But he was ready for me and jumped forward with the knife while I was swinging the chain. He sliced at my arm and just missed it. The chain, on its recoil, wrapped around his skinny neck like a lover. Mack&#x2019;s yell of triumph turned into a gurgle. He dropped the knife and clawed at the links with both hands. Losing air, he dropped to his knees on the rough pavement, yanking the chain from my hand.<br><br>Well, there went Jason&#x2019;s chain. I swooped down and scooped up Mack&#x2019;s knife, holding it like I knew how to use it.

Caught in this shifting world of fanaticism, ambition, duplicity, and violent death are the foreign helicopter pilots who have been servicing the oil fields up and down the country. Their one objective is to make a bold, concerted escape to safety across the Gulf.</p><p>James Clavell (1921-1994) was a novelist, screenwriter, director, and World War II veteran and prisoner of war. He is best known for his epic Asian Saga series of novels and their televised adaptations, along with screenplays for such films as &#34;The Great Escape, The Fly&#34;, and &#34;To Sir, with Love&#34;. His books &#34;Noble House&#34; and&#34; Whirlwind&#34; were #1 &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers.Andrew Gavallan, based in Scotland, runs a helicopter company operating in Iran during the Shah's reign. When Khomeini comes to power, Gavallan must get his pilots and their families, and his valuable helicopters, out of the riot-torn country. Complicating matters is his power struggle with his company's secret owner, the Noble House of Hong Kong. The pilots' escape efforts form the basic story but as usual in a Clavell novel the action sweeps across many lives: lovers, spies, fanatics, revolutionaries, friends and betrayers. British, Finnish, American, and Iranian, all are caught up in a deadly religious and political upheaval. Clavell effectively portrays the chilling and bewildering encounters when Westernized lifestyle clashes with harsh ancient traditions. This novel, the fifth in what he calls his Asian Series ( Noble H o use, King Rat, Tai Pan, Shogun ) is certain to be in much demand. A.M.B.

In Cycles of Time, Penrose offers a completely new perspective on the often-asked question, &#39;what came before the Big Bang?&#39; The answer that Penrose proposes involves a curious but fully rational way of looking at the expected ultimate fate of our acclerating expanded universe, and showing that its end can in fact be reinterpreted as the &#39;Big Bang&#39; of a new universe.</p><p>Professor SIR ROGER PENROSE is Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford. He has received a number of prizes and awards, including the 1988 Wolf Prize for physics which he shared with Stephen Hawking for their joint contribution to our understanding of the universe.<b>PREFACE</b><br><br>One of the deepest mysteries of our universe is the puzzle of whence it came.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I entered Cambridge University as a mathematics graduate student, in the early 1950s, a fascinating cosmological theory was in the ascendant, known as the steady-state model. According to this scheme, the universe had no beginning, and it remained more-or-less the same, overall, for all time. The steady-state universe was able to achieve this, despite its expansion, because the continual depletion of material arising from the universe&#x2019;s expansion is taken to be compensated by the continual creation of new material, in the form of an extremely diffuse hydrogen gas. My friend and mentor at Cambridge, the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, from whom I learnt the thrill of so much new physics, was at that time a strong proponent of steady-state cosmology, and he impressed upon me the beauty and power of that remarkable scheme of things.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet this theory has not stood the test of time. About 10 years after I had first entered Cambridge, and had become well acquainted with the theory, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered, to their own surprise, an all-pervading electromagnetic radiation, coming in from all directions, now referred to as the cosmic microwave background or CMB. This was soon identified, by Robert Dicke, as a predicted implication of the &#x2018;flash&#x2019; of a Big-Bang origin to the universe, now presumed to have taken place some 14 thousand million years ago&#x2014;an event that had been first seriously envisaged by Monsignor Georges Lema�tre in 1927, as an implication of his work on Einstein&#x2019;s 1915 equations of general relativity and early observational indications of an expansion of the universe. With great courage and scientific honesty (when the CMB data became better established), Dennis Sciama publicly repudiated his earlier views and strongly supported the idea of the Big Bang origin to the universe from then on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since that time, cosmology has matured from a speculative pursuit into an exact science, and intense analysis of the CMB&#x2014;coming from highly detailed data, generated by numerous superb experiments&#x2014;has formed a major part of this revolution. However, many mysteries remain, and much speculation continues to be part of this endeavour. In this book, I provide descriptions not only of the main models of classical relativistic cosmology but also of various developments and puzzling issues that have arisen since then. Most particularly, there is a profound oddness underlying the Second Law of thermodynamics and the very nature of the Big Bang. In relation to this, I am putting forward a body of speculation of my own, which brings together many strands of different aspects of the universe we know.<br> &nbsp;<br> My own unorthodox approach dates from the summer of 2005, though much of the detail is more recent. This account goes seriously into some of the geometry, but I have refrained from including, in the main body of the text, anything serious in the way of equations or other technicalities, all these being banished to the Appendices. The experts, only, are referred to those parts of the book. The scheme that I am now arguing for here is indeed unorthodox, yet it is based on geometrical and physical ideas which are very soundly based. Although something entirely different, this proposal turns out to have strong echoes of the old steady-state model!<br> &nbsp;<br> I wonder what Dennis Sciama would have made of it.</p><h2>Working with Parents Makes Therapy Work</h2><p>Working With Parents Makes Therapy Work demonstrates the crucial role of parent work in child and adolescent therapy The Novicks suggest that restoring the parent-child relationship contributes to long-lasting therapeutic change in children and adolescents With a multitude of vivid clinical examples the authors provide a practical guide to clinical techniques for integrating parent work with individual child and adolescent treatment Working With Parents Makes Therapy Work demonstrates that parents and therapists can form a strong alliance to support the childs healthy development Kerry and Jack Novick apply their revised models of the therapeutic alliance and two systems of self-regulation to help parents from evaluation to termination and beyond The book covers a wide range of situations for instance work with fathers addressing problems of divorce and diverse family structures and many modes of communicating with parents Family secrets and loyalty conflicts what happens when parents are troubled the importance of parents in the lives of teenagers-these are all discussed in detail Privacy and secrecy are defined and differentiated to clarify the meaning and importance of genuine confidentiality</p><p><b>Kerry Kelly Novick</b> and <b>Jack Novick</b> are child, adolescent, and adult psychoanalysts on the faculty of the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute. They have been working with children and families for 35 years and joined other colleagues to found a non-profit psychoanalytic school, Allen Creek Preschool, in Ann Arbor. Both Jack and Kerry Novick have written extensively. Their first book, <i>Fearful Symmetry: The Development and Treatment of Sadomasochism</i>, appeared in 1996.A comprehensive, reader friendly and exceptionally informative guide for properly identifying and contributing to a healthy parent-child relationship for the potential and long-lasting benefit of the child in a therapeutic pursuit. Supplying an expansively illustrative content of examples, studies, in-depth detailing, <i>Working with Parents Makes Therapy Work</i> covers diverse but common situations. Vitally important reading for counselors and psychotherapists working with families in clinical settings, <i>Working with Parents Makes Therapy Work</i> is also very highly recommended for the struggling parents of struggling children and teens for its invaluable and accessible contribution of helpful insights and general content. (<i>The Bookwatch</i>)<br><br>Working With Parents Makes Therapy Work is a rare book. It is a book on a subject that is almost never written about in psychoanalysis. This is also a rare book for another reason: while it makes no extravagant claims, it quietly turns the traditional way of thinking about parent work in child analysis on its head. For this reason especially, all child analysts should read it and consider its message. This book has an interesting mix of practical advice and theoretical ideas. It is useful for clinicians at all levels of experience. A new and thoughtful look at how we work with the families of the children we treat is most refreshing and long overdue. This view is especially relevant since it is based on years of clinical practice by two excellent clinicians.. (<i>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association</i>)<br><br>For far too long parents have been denied their rightful place as partners in therapeutic work on behalf of their children. The Novicks advocate unequivocally for their inclusion when working with children of every age and in every phase of development.

(Denia Barrett, Editor, Child Analysis: Clinical, Theoretical, and Applied)<br><br><i>Working with Parents Makes Therapy Work</i> by Kerry and Jack Novick is an extraordinarily important contribution. Their work effectively counters the decades-old resistance to caring work with parents by child and adolescent psychoanalysts and psychotherapists.

One of this volume's many strengths lies in its use of numerous salient and well-crafted clinical illustrations derived from the authors' extensive clinical and supervisory experience. It also offers further elaboration and new applications of the Novicks' earlier research on the "two-systems" model. Indeed, because the work is so well written, one nearly loses sight of the fact that it represents a bold new vision of the role of parents in the psychoanalytic treatment of child and adolescent patients.

The fruitless fall nearly became a reality last year when beekeepers watched one third of the honeybee population&#x2015;thirty billion bees&#x2015;mysteriously die. The deaths have continued in 2008. Rowan Jacobsen uses the mystery of Colony Collapse Disorder to tell the bigger story of bees and their' essential connection to our daily lives. With their disappearance, we won't just be losing honey. Industrial agriculture depends on the honeybee to pollinate most fruits, nuts, and vegetables&#x2015;one third of American crops. Yet this system is falling apart. The number of these professional pollinators has become so inadequate that they are now trucked across the country and flown around the world, pushing them ever closer to collapse. By exploring the causes of CCD and the even more chilling decline of wild pollinators, <i>Fruitless Fall</i> does more than just highlight this growing agricultural crisis. It emphasizes the miracle of flowering plants and their pollination partners, and urges readers not to take for granted the Edenic garden <i>Homo sapiens</i> has played in since birth. Our world could have been utterly different&#x2015;and may be still.</p></p><p><b>Rowan Jacobsen</b> writes about food, the environment, and the connections between the two.

You can't finish this book unconvinced that our food supply is in serious danger.

[Jacobsen's] analysis is helpful and instructive.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this densely woven account of waggle dances, almond trees, and confounded pathologists, Jacobsen tells the story of CCD: how it happened, the likely culprits, and its implications for the future of agriculture.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Seed</i></p><p>&#x201c;In his very scary Fruitless Fall, Rowan Jacobsen explains in layman's terms and with a rising urgency why autumn's mellow fruitfulness won't happen unless we take better care of that industrious pollinator Apis mellifera, the honeybee. To write his book, Mr. Jacobsen had to take a "bee's-eye view of the world," but the result is surprisingly human: It's the story of a close and enduring partnership that crashed in 2006 with the onset of colony collapse disorder...Fruitless Fall is a passionate sequel to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and we'd better listen up before we get to winter kills.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Well-informed...For many readers, it may make the mystery of CCD easier to comprehend.

For more information, please go to www.eric-carle.com.PreSchool-Grade 4 A handsome compilation of 22 stories selected from the previ ously published Twelve Tales From Aesop (Philomel, 1980; o.p.), Seven Stories from Hans Christian Andersen (Watts, 1978; o.p.), and Eric Carle's Storybook: Seven Stories from the Brothers Grimm (Watts, 1976; o.p.). The result is a varied selection ranging from familiar tales such as Tom Thumb and The Rabbit and the Turtle to more obscure stories including The Seven Swabians and The Winners. Ar rangement is well balanced, with the short fables interspersed among the longer stories of Andersen and Grimm. Stories appear virtually verba tim from the first editions with con cise, spirited language in keeping with the nature of the tales. Carle has pared down the original versions, sometimes at the expense of the irony and humor; this is most notably absent in the selections from Andersen. He has also invented some plot twists to make the tales more logical in their shortened form. The 11 fables from Aesop are presented with no ultimate ly stated morals but retain their teach ing spirit, although the message of The Grasshopper and the Ants has been completely reversed. Carle's distinc tive style of bright watercolor and col lage illustration provides an excellent complement to the lively text. Most of the art from the original volumes has been reproduced, supplemented with some new illustrations. The reproduc tions have been toned down slightly from the more garish originals, result ing in improved color and clarity. An adequate choice for those mid-range readers who are too old for nursery story collections yet too young for the original full-length tales.

Seraph-class,&#x201d; the tactical officer, Lieutenant Hikowa, replied. Her porcelain features darkened. &#x201c;Tricky bastard must have powered down and slipped past our sentry ships.&#x201d;</p><p>A humorless grin tugged at Keyes&#x2019; mouth. Hikowa was a first-rate tactical officer, utterly ruthless in a fight. She seemed to take the Covenant fighter pilot&#x2019;s actions as a personal insult. &#x201c;Teach him a lesson, Lieutenant,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She nodded and tapped a series of orders into her panel&#x2014;new orders for the <i>Autumn</i>&#x2019;s fighter squadron.</p><p>A moment later, there was radio chatter as one of the <i>Autumn</i>&#x2019;s C709 Longsword fighters went after the Seraph, followed by a cheer as the tiny alien ship transformed into a momentary sun, complete with its own system of co-orbiting debris.</p><p>Keyes wiped a trickle of sweat from his forehead. He checked his display&#x2014;they&#x2019;d reverted back into real space twenty minutes ago. <i>Twenty minutes</i>, and the Covenant picket patrols had already found them and started shooting.</p><p>He turned to the bridge&#x2019;s main viewport, a large transparent bubble slung beneath the <i>Autumn</i>&#x2019;s bow superstructure. A massive purple gas giant&#x2014;Threshold&#x2014;dominated the spectacular view. One of the Longsword fighters glided past as it continued its patrol.</p><p>When Keyes had been given command of the <i>Pillar of Autumn</i>, he&#x2019;d been skeptical of the large, domed viewport. &#x201c;The Covenant are tough enough,&#x201d; he had argued to Vice Admiral Stanforth. &#x201c;Why give them an easy shot into my bridge?&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;d lost the argument&#x2014;captains don&#x2019;t win debates with admirals, and in any case there simply hadn&#x2019;t been time to armor the viewport. He had to admit, though, the view was almost worth the risk. Almost.</p><p>He absently toyed with the pipe he habitually carried, lost in thought. It ran completely counter to his nature to slink around in the shadow of a gas giant. He respected the Covenant as a dangerous, deadly enemy, and hated them for their savage butchery of human colonists and fellow soldiers alike. He had never feared them, however. Soldiers didn&#x2019;t hide from the enemy&#x2014;they met the enemy head-on.</p><p>He moved back to the command station and activated his navigation suite. He plotted a course deeper in-system, and fed the data to Ensign Lovell, the navigator.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain,&#x201d; Hikowa piped up. &#x201c;Sensors paint a squadron of enemy fighters inbound. Looks like boarding craft are right behind them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was just a matter of time, Lieutenant.&#x201d; He sighed. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t hide here forever.&#x201d;</p><p>The <i>Autumn</i> seemed to glide out of the shadow cast by the gas giant, and into bright sunlight.</p><p>Keyes&#x2019; eyes widened with surprise as the ship cleared the gas giant. He had expected to see a Covenant cruiser, Seraph fighters, or some other military threat.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t expected to see the massive object floating in a Lagrange point between Threshold and its moon, Basis.</p><p>The construct was enormous&#x2014;a ring-shaped object that shimmered and glowed with reflected starlight, like a jewel lit from within.</p><p>The outer surface was metallic and seemed to be engraved with deep geometric patterns. &#x201c;Cortana,&#x201d; Captain Keyes said. &#x201c;What <i>is</i> that?&#x201d;</p><p>A thirty-centimeter-high hologram faded into view above a small holopad near the captain&#x2019;s station. Cortana&#x2014;the ship&#x2019;s powerful artificial intelligence&#x2014;frowned as she activated the ship&#x2019;s long-range detection gear. Long lines of digits scrolled across the sensor displays and rippled the length of Cortana&#x2019;s &#x201c;body&#x201d; as well.</p><p>&#x201c;The ring is ten thousand kilometers in diameter,&#x201d; Cortana announced, &#x201c;and twenty-two point three kilometers thick. Spectroscopic analysis is inconclusive, but patterns do not match any known Covenant materials, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Keyes nodded. The preliminary finding was interesting, <i>very</i> interesting, since Covenant ships had already been present when the <i>Autumn</i> dropped out of Slipspace and right into their laps. When he first saw the ring, Keyes had a sinking feeling that the construct was a large Covenant installation&#x2014;one far beyond the scope of human engineering. The thought that the construct might also be beyond <i>Covenant</i> engineering held some small comfort.</p><p>It also made him nervous.</p><p>Under intense pressure from enemy warships in the Epsilon Eridani system&#x2014;the location of the UNSC&#x2019;s last major naval base, Reach&#x2014;Cortana had been forced to launch the ship toward a random set of coordinates, a standard procedure to lead the Covenant forces away from Earth.</p><p>Now it appeared that the men and women aboard the <i>Pillar of Autumn</i> had not succeeded in leaving their original pursuers behind. The Covenant had followed them <i>here</i>. Wherever &#x201c;here&#x201d; was.</p><p>Cortana aimed a long-range camera array at the ring and a close-up snapped into focus. Keyes let out a long, slow whistle. The construct&#x2019;s inner surface was a mosaic of greens, blues, and browns&#x2014;trackless desert, jungles, glaciers, and oceans. Streaks of white clouds cast deep shadows on the terrain below. The ring rotated and brought a new feature into view: a tremendous hurricane forming over a large body of water.</p><p>Equations again scrolled across the AI&#x2019;s semitransparent body as she continued to evaluate the incoming data. &#x201c;Captain,&#x201d; Cortana said, &#x201c;the object is clearly artificial. There&#x2019;s a gravity field that controls the ring&#x2019;s spin and keeps the atmosphere inside. I can&#x2019;t say with one hundred percent certainty, but it appears that the ring has an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, and Earth-normal gravity.&#x201d;</p><p>Keyes raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s artificial, who the hell built it, and what in God&#x2019;s name is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Cortana processed the question for a full three seconds. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, sir.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Regulations be damned,</i> Keyes thought. He took out his pipe, used an old-fashioned match to light it, and produced a puff of fragrant smoke. The ringworld shimmered on the status monitors. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;d better find out.&#x201d;</p><p>Sam Marcus rubbed his aching neck with hands that trembled with fatigue. The rush of adrenaline that had flooded him when he&#x2019;d received Tech Chief Shephard&#x2019;s instructions had worn off. Now he just felt tired, strung out, and more than a little afraid.</p><p>He shook his head to clear it and surveyed the small observation theater. Each cryostorage bay was equipped with such a station, a central monitoring facility for the hundreds of cryotubes the storage bays held. By shipboard standards, the Cryo Two Observation Theater was large, but the proliferation of life-sign monitors, diagnostic gauges, and computer terminals&#x2014;tied directly into the individual cryotubes stored in the bay below&#x2014;made the room seem cramped and uncomfortable.</p><p>A chime sounded and Sam&#x2019;s eyes swept across the status monitors. There was only one active cryotube in this bay, and its monitor pinged for his attention. He double-checked the main instrument panel, then keyed the intercom. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming around, sir,&#x201d; he said. He turned and looked out the observation bay&#x2019;s window.</p><p>Tech Chief Thom Shephard waved up at Sam from the floor of Cryostorage Unit Two. &#x201c;Good work, Sam,&#x201d; he called back. &#x201c;Almost time to pop the seal.&#x201d;</p><p>The status monitors continued to feed information to the observation theater. The subject&#x2019;s body temperature was approaching normal&#x2014;at least, Sam assumed it was normal; he&#x2019;d never awakened a Spartan before&#x2014;and most of the chemicals had already been flushed out of his system.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in a REM cycle now, Chief,&#x201d; Sam called out, &#x201c;and his brainwave activity shows he&#x2019;s dreaming&#x2014;that means he&#x2019;s pretty much thawed. Shouldn&#x2019;t be long now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Shephard replied. &#x201c;Keep an eye on those neuro readings. We packed him in wearing his combat armor. There may be some feedback effects to watch out for.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Acknowledged.&#x201d;</p><p>A red light winked to life on the security terminal, and a new series of codes flashed across the screen:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;WAKE-UP SERIES STANDBY. SECURITY LOCK [PRIORITY ALPHA] ENGAGED.<br>&gt;X-CORTANA.1.0&#x2013;CRYOSTOR.23.4.7</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; Sam muttered. He keyed the bay intercom again. &#x201c;Thom? There&#x2019;s something weird here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some kind of security lockout from the bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Acknowledged.&#x201d; There was a static-spotted click as Shephard looped in the bridge channel. &#x201c;Cryo Two to Bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead, Cryo Two,&#x201d; a female voice replied, laced with the telltale warble of synthesized speech.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready to pop the seal on our .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. guest, Cortana,&#x201d; Shephard explained. &#x201c;We need&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;the security code,&#x201d; the AI finished. &#x201c;Transmitting.

A mesmerizing and achingly beautiful debut.<br>Winter, 1919. Amanda Starkey spends her days nursing soldiers wounded in the Great War. Finding herself suddenly overwhelmed, she flees Milwaukee and retreats to her family's farm on Nagawaukee Lake, seeking comfort with her younger sister, Mathilda, and three-year-old niece, Ruth. But very soon, Amanda comes to see that her old home is no refuge--she has carried her troubles with her. On one terrible night almost a year later, Amanda loses nearly everything that is dearest to her when her sister mysteriously disappears and is later found drowned beneath the ice that covers the lake. When Mathilda's husband comes home from the war, wounded and troubled himself, he finds that Amanda has taken charge of Ruth and the farm, assuming her responsibility with a frightening intensity. Wry and guarded, Amanda tells the story of her family in careful doses, as anxious to hide from herself as from us the secrets of her own past and of that night.<br>Ruth, haunted by her own memory of that fateful night, grows up under the watchful eye of her prickly and possessive aunt and gradually becomes aware of the odd events of her childhood. As she tells her own story with increasing clarity, she reveals the mounting toll that her aunt's secrets exact from her family and everyone around her, until the heartrending truth is uncovered.<br>Guiding us through the lives of the Starkey women, Christina Schwarz's first novel shows her compassion and a unique understanding of the American landscape and the people who live on it.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, September 2000:</b> For 19th-century novelists--from Jane Austen to George Eliot, Flaubert to Henry James--social constraint gave a delicious tension to their plots. Yet now our relaxed morals and social mobility have rendered many of the classics untenable. Why shouldn't Maisie know what she knows? It will all come out in family therapy anyway. The vogue for historical novels depends in part on our pleasure in reentering a world of subtle cues and repressed emotion, a time in which a young woman could destroy her life by saying yes to the wrong man. After all, there was no reliable birth control, no divorce, no chance of an independent life or a scandal-free separation. <p>Christina Schwarz's suspenseful debut pivots on two of the lost "virtues" of the past: silence and stoicism. <i>Drowning Ruth</i> opens in 1919, on the heels of the influenza epidemic that followed the First World War. Although there were telephones and motor cars and dance halls in the small towns of Wisconsin in those years, the townspeople remained rigid and forbidding. As a young woman, Amanda Starkey, a Lutheran farmer's daughter, had been firmly discouraged from an inappropriate marriage with a neighboring Catholic boy. A few years later, as a nurse in Milwaukee, she is seduced by a dishonorable man. Her shame sends her into a nervous breakdown, and she returns to the family farm. Within a year, though, her beloved sister Mathilde drowns under mysterious circumstances. And when Mathilde's husband, Carl, returns from the war, he finds his small daughter, Ruth, in Amanda's tenacious grip, and she will tell him nothing about the night his wife drowned. Amanda's parents, too, are long gone. "I killed my parents. Had I mentioned that?" muses Amanda. </p><blockquote> I killed them because I felt a little fatigued and suffered from a slight, persistent cough. Thinking I was overworked and hadn't been getting enough sleep, I went home for a short visit, just a few days to relax in the country while the sweet corn and the raspberries were ripe. From the city I brought fancy ribbon, two boxes of Ambrosia chocolate, and a deadly gift... I gave the influenza to my mother, who gave it to my father, or maybe it was the other way around. </blockquote> Schwarz is a skillful writer, weaving her grim tale across several decades, always returning to the fateful night of Mathilde's death. <i>Drowning Ruth</i> displays her gift for pacing and her harsh insistence on the right ending, rather than the cheery one. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"A strong sense of portent and unusually vivid characters distinguish this mesmerizing first novel about horrifying family secrets and nearly annihilating guilt. <b>Drowning Ruth</b> is a complex and rewarding debut." <br>--Anita Shreve, author of <b>Fortune's Rocks</b> and <b>The Pilot's Wife</b></p><h2>Fluffy&#39;s Field Trip (Hello Reader, Level 3)</h2><p>Fluffy the guinea pig accidentally accompanies Ms. Day&#39;s class on a field trip to the planetarium and, inspired by the constellations Pegasus, The Big Dipper, and The Great Bear, Fluffy dreams up some of his own.

Now he has no idea how many commissioners there are, and he orders his royal advisors to gather and count them as they walk through the door. The first advisor counts by twos, the second by fives, and the little princess by tens. Of course, they all arrive at the same answer. The king is utterly perplexed, but his daughter clears up the mystery and readers learn the value of multiplication. Guevara combines cartoon and primitive styles to create zany, exaggerated, brightly colored illustrations?the perfect complement to the silly story. The portrayal of the simpleminded king is especially amusing. The story is appropriate for whole-language units, home-schooling, or for anyone who wants to show the fun and useful role of math in everyday life. Ruby Dee's Two Ways to Count to Ten (Holt, 1990) and Kay Chorao's Number One Number Fun (Holiday, 1995) present math concepts for younger children in a story format.?Heide Piehler, Shorewood Public Library, WI<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5-7. In the habit of appointing a new royal commissioner whenever he has a problem, the king fears that his government may be getting too big and decides to count all his employees, with the help of two trusted advisors. Counting one by one, the king soon loses track. The first royal advisor, counting by twos, arrives at twenty-three twos plus one more. The second royal advisor, counting by fives, enumerates nine fives plus two more. The king is enraged by the discrepancy until his young daughter explains the concept of place value, reassuring him that everyone has correctly tallied 47 commissioners. Guevara's brightly colored acrylic paintings add humor to the text and will appeal to young listeners. An appended section for adults discusses mathematical concepts and suggests questions for use with children.

Why not be done with it? David Dark argues that it's not that simple. The ease with which we put the label on others without applying it to ourselves is an evasion, a way of avoiding awareness of our own messy allegiances. Dark writes: "If what we believe is what we see is what we do is who we are, there's no getting away from religion." Both incisive and entertaining, <em>Life's Too Short to Pretend You're Not Religious</em> combines Dark's keen powers of cultural observation with candor and wit. With equal parts memoir and analysis, Dark persuasively argues that the fact of religion is the fact of relationship. It's the shape our love takes, the lived witness of everything we're up to for better or worse, because witness knows no division. Looking hard at our weird religious background (Dark maintains we all have one) can bring the actual content of our everyday existence&#x2015;the good, the bad and the glaringly inconsistent&#x2015;to fuller consciousness. By doing so, we can more practically envision an undivided life and reclaim the idea of being "religious."</p><p>"David Dark is one of our most astute and necessary cultural critics. His work gracefully opens new doors of understanding and breaks down barriers between secular and non-, and it puts a lot of old mythology out to pasture with a daring affirmation at the heart of his radical critique. <em>Life's Too Short</em> refreshingly ropes everyone in, insisting that we're all in it together. We forget that." (Jessica Hopper, author of The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic)<br><br>"Effectively skewering a central fallacy of the age, David Dark argues that at the deepest level no one is more or less religious than anyone else. With his premise granted, new avenues for ownership, responsibility and a renewed attentiveness to all we say, do and think arise. <em>Life's Too Short to Pretend You're Not Religious</em> is a call to consciousness and the compassion that accompanies the sacred insight that the whole world is kin and everything belongs." (Richard Rohr, O.F.M., Center for Action and Contemplation, Albuquerque, New Mexico)<br><br>"Brace yourself. Our bold conceits, wishful thinking and soothing sobriquets on the abolition of religion and the end of faith are set on a collision course thanks to David Dark's luminous reckonings with the real. The result is a shock of recognition: life more abundant awaits us only in the deep immersions of togetherness with others. Here alone are the comedy and chaos that define the human condition and lead us gently or not into the strange new world of grace. <em>Life's Too Short to Pretend You're Not Religious</em> is an irresistible triumph." (Charles Marsh, Commonwealth Professor of Religious Studies, University of Virginia, author of Strange Glory: A Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer)<br><br>"Don't let an aversion toward that radioactive word dissuade you. <em>Life's Too Short to Pretend You're Not Religious</em> is a bracing manifesto for modern people and an optimism-infused love song to humanity. David Dark calls us to pay better, more generous attention to our own lives and the lives of others." (Sara Zarr, National Book Award finalist, author of The Lucy Variations)<br><br>"Prepare to have idols smashed. David Dark renders futile the cherished modern ambition to opt out of human religiosity; religion, rather, is a road we can make by walking with open eyes and informed minds. No marvels of progress can save us from being heretics and holy fools, or prophets, seers and miracle workers. Dark helps us recognize these characters (and more) on the radio, in a dreary parking lot and within ourselves." (Nathan Schneider, columnist for America magazine, author of God in Proof and Thank You, Anarchy)<br><br>"David Dark is one of the most important prophetic voices of our day. <em>Life's Too Short to Pretend You're Not Religious</em> is another beautiful demonstration of the winsome way in which he unsettles our language and our imagination. Not content to unravel the basic fabric of our existence, Dark reweaves the fibers into a rich and vibrant vision of the flourishing religious life for which we were created." (C. Christopher Smith, coauthor of Slow Church and founding editor of The Englewood Review of Books)<br><br>"I am so very grateful for this book, which, among other things, demonstrates that answering 'Jedi' or 'Toni Morrison' when asked for your religious affiliation is a perfectly legitimate response to that question-thereby arguing us into another definition of what it means to be alive to wonder and mystery. And at a time in our culture when we seem to prefer our 'dialogues' to be conducted behind well-defended barricades from which we lob Twitter grenades, David Dark shows us that there could be another way to live with each other and speak with each other. Each sentence here is graced with a wisdom, humor and humility that can't help but inspire us to be a little less suspicious of each other and to hope a little bit more-and if that isn't a rare gift of prophecy, I don't know what is. Also, he writes like an unprintable word, and for that I am glad." (Carlene Bauer, author of Frances and Bernard and Not That Kind of Girl)<br><br>"David Dark has a request for all of us. Stop thinking of being religious as passivity. Stop thinking of it as participation in something monolithic, intractable and stagnated by centuries of routine. In his new book, he asks us instead to find religion all around us: in music, television, books and film. In doing so, he reimagines being religious as a collective action open to all and demonstrates that in a time skeptical of religion, it can be a source of meaningful work and lifegiving pleasure and joy-and even of change." (Kaya Oakes, College Writing Programs, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br>"Having just finished David Dark's new book, I want to buy stock in Religion Unlimited, meaning that David helps us see why pronouncing religion dead or dying is terribly short-sighted. The writing is muscular yet graceful, and the content is wise and insightful. You couldn't ask more from a book . . . and you couldn't ask for a more important subject." (Brian D. McLaren, author, speaker, activist)David Dark teaches in the College of Theology at Belmont University and among the incarcerated communities of Nashville, Tennessee.

He&#x2019;d no idea at the time&#x2014;he still didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;how Master Yoru had divined his intention, his purpose . . . his Plan. But somehow, he had. Bruce Wayne had known that from nearly the first day they&#x2019;d met, in the peaceful dojo of lacquered wood and painted shoji, and he knew that the martial arts master had known he knew.<br><br>Eighty years old, at least, and nearly blind in one eye, judging by the cloud of cataract tissue that had spread across it. Yet he&#x2019;d still been able to move like water between rocks, strike like iron against rice paper. No one in the dojo could touch him. Bruce doubted that any- one in the East could touch him.<br><br>He had learned much.<br><br>Trust the night.<br><br>The phrase always flickered like heat lightning through his mind as he entered the shadows. He quickly descended the rungs of rusted and verdigris-crusted iron, his cloak draping him. The tunnels were almost large enough to stand in upright; the storm drains and sewers that snaked below Gotham City rivaled those of Paris or Vienna in their size and complexity. They&#x2014;and the rooftops&#x2014;were by far the quickest and easiest way to get from one area of the city to another.<br><br>He moved swiftly along the relatively dry embankment. The sewer stench didn&#x2019;t bother him; he was used to it, plus he had daubed mentholated salve beneath his nostrils before leaving the car. It was a practice he had learned watching coroners and forensics investigators working over cadavers.<br><br>The darkness was nearly total, but his footing was sure, despite the occasional patches of slime and offal on the wet concrete. The wafer-thin white gallium arsenide plates that hid his eyes were Generation Five light amplifiers, developed, as was so much of his personal arsenal, by the R&amp;D staff of Wayne Technologies. Their primary clients were the armed forces and private security firms. Their customer satisfaction quotient was high, largely because he field-tested most of the prototypes himself.<br><br>There were occasional cryptic combinations of numbers and letters stenciled on the curving walls, or at intersections; often these were nearly obliterated by decades of water and mold. They spoke, to those who could read them, of drainage levels, basin and sub-basin locations, outlet control junctions, and the like. They also gave directions. Following these, he turned left at a T-intersection, left again at a branching conduit. Eventually he was stopped by a rust-weakened iron grid, which one thrust of his booted heel easily reduced to chunky powder.<br><br>He was now in what the city infrastructure plans called the North Corridor Project. This had been originally intended as a linking commuter line, but had been abandoned in the late 1960s, when it was decided to put the Diamond Express Line in at a deeper level. The corridor now served as an emergency runoff drain during severe storms.<br><br>It would also, in this case, serve as an emergency access to the runaway train.<br><br>A small heads-up display blinked on just above his left eye plate, summoned by a subvocalized command. Along with a compass, temperature gauge, and air toxicity sampler, it gave him a digital time readout.<br><br>He had less than thirty seconds.<br><br>From one of his belt compartments he took a small quantity of plastic explosive and quickly molded it in a three-foot-wide circle in the center of the corridor&#x2019;s floor. The material was another WayneTech development&#x2014;it had a TNT equivalence 20 percent higher than C4, and a brisance factor of thirty thousand feet per second. He moved back ten feet, shielded himself with his cloak, and triggered the built-in soft-circuit detonator.<br><br>The flash was dazzling, even with the Gen-5 polarizers. The audio circuitry in the cowl dampened the sound of the blast, and the shaped charge directed most of the concussion wave downward. Even so, it was not an experience he cared to repeat anytime soon.<br><br>Through the mist of aerosolized concrete and masonry he could see a ragged hole, its circumference punctuated by torn rebar. The eighteen-inch-thick floor of the drain was also, at this juncture, the ceiling of the Diamond Express tunnel.<br><br>Even as he stepped forward, he could feel the vibration beneath him begin to build, could see the faint light of the approaching train.<br><br>He would have only one shot at this.<br><br>He gathered the cloak around him, stepped forward, and dropped through the hole.<br><br>Trust the night.<br><br>For nearly five years now it had been his best ally; better than the R&amp;D team, with their white lab coats and their computer modeling and their solemn expressions; certainly better than the GCPD, by turns brutal and blundering, with one of the lowest credibility ratings of any city in the country; even better than Alfred Pennyworth, esq., that irreplaceable and irrepressible butler who was also a certified field medic, a fair mechanic, a passable cook, and many more things, not the least of which was surrogate family and confidant without peer. It was the truth, pure and simple; he could not have done any of this without Alfred&#x2019;s help and support. He wasn&#x2019;t sure the butler would take that as a sterling character recommendation, but it was true nonetheless.<br><br>Yet even so, the darkness remained his first and foremost ally. It sheltered him, created and maintained the fear his enemies felt for him&#x2014;even, in an odd way, nourished him. After all, he had lived with it for so long . . . ever since the age of eight.<br><br>Now, as he dropped through the hole, the darkness once again welcomed him. He landed lightly, one foot on either side of the third rail. The light was increasing steadily, as was the vibration. He leapt quickly to the narrow maintenance walkway that ran the length of the tunnel.<br><br>The roar of the wheels against the track grew louder. The cowl&#x2019;s circuitry automatically dampened anything over eighty-five dB but could do nothing about the bone-jarring vibration. The light filled the tunnel with stark, flowing chiaroscuro. He estimated the train&#x2019;s speed at better than sixty miles per hour. Faces in the windows flickered by, less than eighteen inches from him, a magic lantern of terror.<br><br>The timing had to be perfect; he wouldn&#x2019;t get a second chance.<br><br>The instant the last car shot past, he jumped.<br><br>His fingers locked around the rear guard railing; his feet found the plate. His cape snapped out to its full length behind him. The network of aramid polyfibers woven into his suit tightened in response to the sudden stress and kept his shoulders from being dislocated, although just barely. He pulled himself forward, fighting the momentum of the train. In situations like these, the cape was more a hindrance than a help, although it was light enough not to seriously impede him.<br><br>He tried the door but, not surprisingly, it was locked. He could see through the car&#x2019;s rear window that the interior was empty, save for an old couple huddled in one of the forward seats. He motioned to them, gesturing that they should let him in, but it was obvious that they were too frightened to move.<br><br>The train&#x2019;s momentum and sway made it impossible to try to cut or force the door open; the same applied to the reinforced window. He had to find another way to stop the hurtling juggernaut.<br><br>There was but one way, insane though it seemed. He had to reach the front of the train, and only one route was even remotely possible.<br><br>He reached up, seized the edge of the car&#x2019;s roof, and pulled himself up. Another moment and he was spread-eagled on the convex surface.<br><br>He kept himself flattened out as much as possible; there was less than two feet of clearance between the top of the car and the tunnel ceiling. Emergency light boxes mounted at regular intervals narrowed the gap even more.<br><br>He inched forward.<br><br>There were six cars; it felt like sixty. He crawled toward the lead car with agonizing slowness, acutely aware of the light boxes, piping, and other obstacles whizzing by so close overhead. Occasionally he glimpsed large, illuminated signs marking emergency exits flashing by. It seemed incredible to him that thrill-seeking teenagers would voluntarily seek out situations like this, yet he knew they did. &#x201c;Subway surfing,&#x201d; they called it. A boy had been killed only last week on the Opal Line, his head crushed to a red ruin when he had misjudged the clearance.<br><br>He wondered why the system fail-safes had not automatically applied the emergency brakes when the routing computer first logged the runaway. He recalled that there had been a collision last year due to a switching mistake. The computer had applied the emergency brakes; the system had worked, insofar as programming went. Due to city budget cutbacks, however, the signal spacing and safety parameters&#x2014;set back in 1907 when trains were slower, shorter, and lighter&#x2014;had never been updated. The emergency brake system had not been able to stop the train in time, and thirty-six people had died. Perhaps something similar had gone awry this time.<br><br>Or perhaps there was another, more sinister reason for this.</p><h2>The Girl Who Soared Over Fairyland and Cut the Moon in Two (Fairyland, 3)</h2><p><p>"One of the most extraordinary works of fantasy, for adults or children, published so far this century."&#x2015;Time magazine, on the Fairyland series</p><p>September misses Fairyland and her friends Ell, the Wyverary, and the boy Saturday.

But Cockburn and St. Clair persuasively argue that the traditional explanation for such events--"rogue elements"--is deliberately misleading, and that the mainstream "liberal" press plays an active role in this obfuscation (noting, for example, that Webb's three biggest attackers were the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>Washington Post</i>). By providing an overarching narrative rather than treating these incidents as isolated, the authors present a damning indictment of the CIA--but one that fully admits that the agency was not acting on its own, but was merely fulfilling the mandates of the American government. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><b>Alexander Cockburn</b> co-edits <i>CounterPunch</i> with Jeffrey St. Clair.

I&#x2019;m here. I&#x2019;m finally here! After years of Olympic-level networking, Eddie had at long last made it&#x2014;he had been invited to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Strictly by invitation only, this prestigious event was the most elite schmoozefest on the planet.<br><br>Every January, the world&#x2019;s most important heads of state, politicians, philanthropists, CEOs, tech leaders, thought leaders, social activists, social entrepreneurs, and, of course, movie stars would descend upon this secluded ski resort high in the Swiss Alps in their private jets, check in to their luxurious hotels, put on their $5,000 ski jackets and ski boots, and engage in meaningful dialogues about such urgent issues as global warming and rising inequality.<br><br>And now Eddie was part of this ultraexclusive club. As the recently appointed senior executive vice chairman of Private Banking (Global) for the Liechtenburg Group, he now found himself standing in the middle of the futuristic auditorium at the Congress Centre, breathing in the rarefied air and catching slivers of his own reflection in the thin chrome leg of an auditorium chair. He was wearing his new bespoke Sartoria Ripense suit, which had been outfitted with an inner lining of ten-ply cashmere so that he never had to wear a ski jacket over it. His new Corthay squirrel suede chukkas had special rubber soles, so he would never slip on the slick Alpine streets. On his wrist was his newest horological acquisition&#x2014;a rose gold A. Lange &amp; S�hne Richard Lange &#x201c;Pour le M�rite,&#x201d; peeking out the precise amount from his sleeve cuff so other watchophiles would see what he was wearing. But most important of all was what he wore over this sartorial splendor&#x2014;a black lanyard at the end of which was attached a white plastic badge with his name printed in the middle: Edison Cheng.<br><br>Eddie fondled the slick plastic badge as if it were a jewel-encrusted amulet, personally bestowed on him by the God of Davos. This badge distinguished him from all the pee-ons at the conference. He wasn&#x2019;t some PR hack, journalist, or one of the common attendees. This white plastic badge with the blue line at the bottom meant that he was an official delegate.<br><br>Eddie glanced around the room at all the clusters of people in hushed conversations, trying to see which dictator, despot, or director he could recognize and connect with. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a tall Chinese man wearing a bright orange ski parka peeking in through the auditorium&#x2019;s side door, seemingly a little lost. Wait a minute, I know that guy. Isn&#x2019;t that Charlie Wu?<br><br>&#x201c;Oy&#x2014;Charlie!&#x201d; Eddie yelled, a little too loudly, as he rushed over toward Charlie. Wait till he sees my official delegate badge!<br><br>Charlie beamed at him in recognition. &#x201c;Eddie Cheng! Did you just get in from Hong Kong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I came from Milan, actually. I was at the men&#x2019;s fall fashion shows&#x2014;front-row seat at Etro.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wow. I guess being one of Hong Kong Tattle&#x2019;s Best Dressed Men is serious work, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Charlie quipped.<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, I made it into the Best Dressed Hall of Fame last year,&#x201d; Eddie replied earnestly. He gave Charlie a quick once-over, noticing that he was wearing khaki pants with cargo pockets and a navy blue pullover under his bright orange parka. What a pity&#x2014;he used to be so fashionable when he was younger, and now he&#x2019;s dressed like every other tech-geek nobody. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your badge, Charlie?&#x201d; Eddie asked, flashing his own proudly.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes, we&#x2019;re supposed to wear them at all times, aren&#x2019;t we? Thanks for reminding me&#x2014;it&#x2019;s somewhere buried in my messenger bag.&#x201d; Charlie dug around for a few seconds before fishing out his badge, and Eddie glanced at it, his curiosity morphing into shocked dismay. Charlie was holding an all-white badge affixed with a shiny holographic sticker. Fucky fuck, this was the most coveted badge! The one they only gave to world leaders! The only other person he had seen so far wearing that badge was Bill Clinton! How the fuck did Charlie get one? All he did was run Asia&#x2019;s biggest tech company!<br><br>Trying to mask his envy, Eddie blurted, &#x201c;Hey, are you attending my panel&#x2014;Apocalypse Asia: How to Secure Your Assets When the China Bubble Really Bursts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m actually on my way to give a talk to IGWEL. What time do you go on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two o&#x2019;clock. What&#x2019;s your talk about?&#x201d; Eddie asked, thinking that he could somehow tag along with Charlie.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anything prepared, really. I think Angela Merkel and some of the Scandinavians just wanted to pick my brain.&#x201d;<br><br>Just then, Charlie&#x2019;s executive assistant, Alice, walked up to join them.<br><br>&#x201c;Alice, look who I found! I knew we&#x2019;d bump into someone from back home sooner or later,&#x201d; Charlie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Cheng, so nice to see you here. Charlie&#x2014;could I have a quick word?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>Alice glanced at Eddie, who looked only too eager for her to continue while he was standing right there. &#x201c;Er . . . would you mind coming with me for a moment?&#x201d; she said diplomatically, guiding Charlie into a side reception room furnished with several lounge chairs and glass-cube coffee tables.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up? Are you still trying to recover from sitting at the same breakfast table with Pharrell?&#x201d; Charlie teased.<br><br>Alice smiled tensely. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a developing situation all morning, and we didn&#x2019;t want to disturb you until we knew more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, spit it out.&#x201d;<br><br>Alice took a deep breath before beginning. &#x201c;I just got the latest update from our head of security in Hong Kong. I don&#x2019;t quite know how to tell you this, but Chloe and Delphine are missing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean missing?&#x201d; Charlie was stunned&#x2014;his daughters were under round-the-clock surveillance, and their pickups and drop-offs were handled with military precision by his SAS-trained security team. Missing was not a variable in their lives.<br><br>&#x201c;Team Chungking was scheduled to pick them up outside Diocesan at 3:50 p.m., but the girls couldn&#x2019;t be located at the school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t be located . . .&#x201d; Charlie mumbled in shock.<br><br>Alice continued, &#x201c;Chloe didn&#x2019;t respond to any of her texts, and Delphine never showed up for choir at two. They thought maybe she sneaked off with her classmate Kathryn Chan to that frozen yogurt shop like she did last time, but then Kathryn turned up at choir practice and Delphine didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did either of them activate their panic codes?&#x201d; Charlie asked, trying to remain calm.<br><br>&#x201c;No, they didn&#x2019;t. Their phones both appear to have been deactivated, so we can&#x2019;t trace them. Team 2046 has already spoken with Commander Kwok&#x2014;the Hong Kong police have been placed on high alert. We also have four of our own teams searching everywhere for them, and the school is now reviewing all their security-camera footage with Mr. Tin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m assuming someone&#x2019;s talked to their mother?&#x201d; Charlie&#x2019;s wife&#x2014;from whom he was estranged&#x2014;lived in their house on The Peak, and the children spent every other week with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Isabel can&#x2019;t be reached. She told the housekeeper that she was meeting her mother for lunch at the Kowloon Cricket Club, but her mother reports that they haven&#x2019;t spoken all week.&#x201d;<br><br>Just then, the cell phone rang again and Alice quickly answered. She listened in silence, nodding her head every now and then. Charlie looked at her pensively. This couldn&#x2019;t be happening. This couldn&#x2019;t be happening. Ten years ago his brother Rob had been kidnapped by the Eleven Finger Triad. It was like d�j� vu all over again.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Tor jeh, tor jeh,&#x201d; Alice said, hanging up. Looking at Charlie, she reported, &#x201c;That was the leader of Team Angels. They now think that Isabel might have left the country. They spoke to the upstairs maid, and Isabel&#x2019;s passport is missing. But for some reason she didn&#x2019;t take any suitcases.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she in the middle of some new treatment?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but apparently she didn&#x2019;t show up at her psychiatrist appointment this week.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie let out a deep sigh. This wasn&#x2019;t a good sign.<br><br>CHAPTER TWO<br><br>fullerton hotel, singapore<br><br>Every month, Rosalind Fung, the property heiress, hosted a Christian Fellowship Banquet for three hundred of her closest girlfriends in the opulent ballroom of the Fullerton Hotel. An invitation to this occasion was highly coveted by a certain segment of Singapore society regardless of their religious affiliation as it was a seal of approval from the old guard (there wasn&#x2019;t a single Chindo or Mainlander in sight), and also because the food was heavenly&#x2014;Rosalind brought in her personal chefs, who took over the hotel&#x2019;s kitchens for one day and prepared an enormous buffet feast consisting of the most mouthwatering Singaporean dishes. Most important&#x2014;this biblical bacchanal was completely free of charge thanks to Rosalind&#x2019;s generosity, although guests were asked to contribute something to the offering basket immediately following the closing prayer.<br><br>Having strategically chosen a table closest to the buffet area, Daisy Foo sighed as she watched Araminta Lee standing in line at the noodle station dishing out some mee siam. &#x201c;Aiyah&#x2014;that Araminta! Bein kar ani laau!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t look old. She just doesn&#x2019;t have any makeup on, that&#x2019;s all. Those supermodel types look like nothing on earth without makeup,&#x201d; Nadine Shaw said as she tucked into her steaming bowl of mee rebus noodles.<br><br>Dousing her mee goreng with more chili oil, Eleanor Young commented, &#x201c;It has nothing to do with that. I used to see her swim at the Churchill Club, and even when she was coming out of the pool dripping wet, she looked beautiful without a stitch of makeup on. Her face has just taken a turn, that&#x2019;s all. She has one of those faces that I always knew would age badly. What is she . . . twenty-seven, twenty-eight now? It&#x2019;s all over for her, lah.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, Lorena Lim and Carol Tai arrived at the table with plates piled dangerously high with food. &#x201c;Wait, wait . . . who&#x2019;s aging badly?&#x201d; Lorena inquired eagerly.<br><br>&#x201c;Araminta Lee. Over at that table with all the Khoo women. Doesn&#x2019;t she look haggard?&#x201d; Nadine said.<br><br>&#x201c;Alamak, bite your tongue, Nadine! Didn&#x2019;t you know she just had a miscarriage?&#x201d; Carol whispered.<br><br>The ladies all stared at Carol, mouths agape. &#x201c;Again? Are you joking? Who told you, lah?&#x201d; Daisy demanded, still chewing on her mee pok.<br><br>&#x201c;Who else? Kitty, lor. Kitty and Araminta are the best of friends now, and ever since this latest miscarriage, she&#x2019;s been spending a lot of time at Kitty&#x2019;s house playing with Gisele. She&#x2019;s completely heartbroken.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How often do you see Kitty and Gisele?&#x201d; Lorena asked, marveling that Carol could be so forgiving of her ex-daughter-in-law&#x2014;the same woman who had cheated on her son, Bernard, with a man Kitty met at the funeral of Carol&#x2019;s late husband and who subsequently dragged Bernard through a particularly acrimonious divorce and custody battle. (Of course, it didn&#x2019;t hurt that Carol abhorred her son&#x2019;s new lifestyle of yoga and &#x201c;that ridiculous Jurassic diet,&#x201d; both of which she considered to be satanic.)<br><br>&#x201c;I go over to Kitty&#x2019;s at least once a week, and Gisele comes to church with me every Sunday,&#x201d; Carol proudly reported.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it healthy for Araminta to be playing with your granddaughter when she just lost her own baby?&#x201d; Nadine wondered out loud.<br><br>&#x201c;Aiyah, I&#x2019;m sure old Mrs. Khoo must be giving Araminta soooo much pressure to produce a grandson! It&#x2019;s been five years since she married Colin! My Nicky and Rachel have been married for two years now, and they still won&#x2019;t give me a grandchild!&#x201d; Eleanor complained.<br><br>&#x201c;But Araminta is still young. She has plenty of time, lah,&#x201d; Nadine argued.<br><br>&#x201c;With all of Dorothy Khoo&#x2019;s side disinherited, Puan&#x2019;s side good-for-nothings, and Nigel Khoo running off and marrying that Russian cabaret singer, who is obviously too old to seh kiah, Colin and Araminta are the last hope to carry on the Khoo name,&#x201d; Daisy commented. Having been born a Wong, of the tin-mining Wongs, Daisy had an encyclopedic knowledge of Singapore&#x2019;s social history.<br><br>The ladies all shook their heads, casting pitiful glances at Araminta, who to anyone else but these women&#x2019;s hypercritical eyes looked perfectly gorgeous and lovely in her yellow striped minidress from Jacquemus.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Eleanor, your niece Astrid just arrived. There&#x2019;s one girl who never seems to age,&#x201d; Carol observed.<br><br>All the women turned to look as Astrid descended the sweeping curved staircase with her mother, Felicity Leong; the society queen Mrs. Lee Yong Chien; and another elderly lady decked out in a cobalt blue sequined hijab.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is that Malay woman wearing that ginormous ruby choker? If that center stone looks as big as it does from here, it must be the size of a lychee up close!&#x201d; Lorena exclaimed. Having been married into the L&#x2019;Orient Jewelry family for more than three decades, she definitely knew her rocks.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh that&#x2019;s the Dowager Sultana of Perawak. She&#x2019;s staying with the Leongs, of course,&#x201d; Eleanor reported.<br><br>&#x201c;Alamak, having royalty as houseguests is such a nuisance!&#x201d; Daisy complained.<br><br>Lorena, like most of the other women in the ballroom, scrutinized Astrid from head to toe as she walked to her table wearing what appeared to be a crisp men&#x2019;s button-down shirt tucked into exquisitely cut navy-and-white gingham cigarette trousers. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true, Astrid actually looks younger and younger every time I see her. Isn&#x2019;t she in her late thirties by now? She looks like an MGS girl coming off the school bus! I bet you she must be sneaking off somewhere and getting things done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can tell you she hasn&#x2019;t had a thing done. She&#x2019;s not the type,&#x201d; Eleanor said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s how she puts it all together. The other girls her age are dressed up like Christmas trees but just look at Astrid . . . hair in a sleek ponytail, ballet flats, not a drop of jewelry except that cross . . . is it turquoise? And that outfit! She looks like Audrey Hepburn on the way to a screen test,&#x201d; Daisy said approvingly as she fished around in her new C�line handbag for a toothpick. &#x201c;Blah-dee-hell! See what my snobby daughter-in-law forces me to carry? She gave me this fancy handbag for my birthday because she&#x2019;s embarrassed of being seen next to me when I&#x2019;m carrying my no-name purse, but I can&#x2019;t ever find anything in here! It&#x2019;s so damn deep, and there are so many damn pockets!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Daisy, will you please stop swearing? We are in the Lord&#x2019;s presence tonight, you know,&#x201d; Carol admonished.<br><br>As if on cue, the Christian Fellowship Banquet&#x2019;s hostess, Rosalind Fung, got up from her table and walked onto the stage. A short, plumpish woman in her mid-sixties with a frizzy spiral perm, Rosalind was dressed in what seemed to be the regulation uniform of every middle-aged old-money Singaporean heiress&#x2014;a sleeveless floral blouse, probably purchased from the clearance rack at John Little, taupe elastic-waist pants, and orthopedic open-toe sandals.

They are partly based on early medieval historical events, but almost certainly hark back to older Iron Age traditions. Its name comes from a misunderstanding made by the Mabinogion&#39;s first English translator, Lady Charlotte Guest: she found at the end of the first tale the form mabynnogyon, a scribal error that was assumed to be the plural of the Welsh word mabinogi, which occurs correctly at the end of the remaining three of the Four Branches. The word mabinogi itself is something of a puzzle, although it is ultimately related to the Welsh mab, which means &#34;son, boy&#34;. Professor Eric P. Hamp, however, suggests that mabinogi derives from the name of the Celtic deity Maponos (&#34;the Divine Son&#34;), and originally referred to materials pertaining to that god. Strictly speaking, &#34;Mabinogi&#34; applies only to the Four Branches (see below), which are speculated to have derived from older tradition. Each of these four tales ends with a colophon meaning &#34;thus ends this branch of the Mabinogi&#34; (in various spellings), hence the name.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Preface by John Updike <br>The 11 stories of "The Mabinogion, first assembled on paper in the fourteenth century, reach far back into the earlier oral traditions of Welsh poetry. <br>Closely linked to the Arthurian legends--King Arthur himself is a character--they summon up a world of mystery and magic that is still evoked by the Welsh landscape they so vividly describe. Mingling fantasy with tales of chivalry, these stories not only prefigure the later medieval romances, but stand on their own as magnificent evocations of a golden age of Celtic civilization. <br>This translation of "The Mabinogion has, since its first appearance in 1949, been recognized as a classic in its own right.

Highly celebrated for his short stories, he's won several awards, including the Hugo and Nebula. He lives in California.</p>Nineteen tales, one from 1964, the rest 1988-93: Bisson's first story collection since the illustrious Voyage to the Red Planet (1990), Talking Man, etc. Bisson's stock in trade is whimsy where, at his best, he combines a splendidly loopy inventiveness with real poignancy, a hard-edged sense of wonder and a grasp of the genuinely alien. The exemplars here: the award-winning title piece, in which bears forgo hibernation in favor of camping out along interstate highway medians, warming themselves at ineptly smoky fires; the funny but affecting long story of alien contact and an aging astronaut (``The Shadow Knows''); a rather untypical life-after-death hair-raiser (``Necronauts''); a quite hysterically bizarre short-short about ``Partial People,'' who are ``people only incompletely seen, or found in boxes, perhaps under benches. Lips and eyes stuck under theatre seats like gum''; and any number of agreeably batty commentaries featuring giant mountains, aliens, famous writers, computers, hunting, winged children, the environment, race relations, time travel, England, and what-all. About half the entries here are amusing if ephemeral; for the remainder, Bisson's distinctive style and priceless imagination lift his work to an altogether more exalted plane. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He in turn invited them to look for him in the sake parlors of the Pleasure Quarters. A Zen monk-poet-calligrapher-musician, he dared to write about the joys of erotic love, along with more traditional Zen themes. He was an eccentric and genius who dared to defy authority and despised corruption.

In the space of a few weeks, the normally sleepy village sees attacks on Vietnamese vendors, arson at a local Asian restaurant, subpar truffles from China smuggled into outgoing shipments at a nearby market&#x2014;all of it threatening the Dordogne&#x2019;s truffle trade, worth millions of dollars each year, and all of it spelling trouble for Beno�t &#x201c;Bruno&#x201d; Courr�ges, master chef, devoted oenophile, and, most important, beloved chief of police. When one of his hunting partners, a noted truffle expert, is murdered, Bruno&#x2019;s investigation into the murky events unfolding around St. Denis becomes infinitely more complicated. His friend wasn&#x2019;t just a connoisseur of French delicacies, he was a former high-profile intelligence agent&#x2014;and someone wanted him dead.<br><br>As the strange crimes continue, Bruno&#x2019;s detective work takes him from sunlit markets to dim caf�s, from luxurious feasts to tense negotiations&#x2014;from all of the paradisial pleasures of the region to its shadowy underworld&#x2014;and reunites him with a lost love, an ambitious policewoman also assigned to the case. Filled with an abundance of food and wine (including, <i>bien s�r,</i> many, many truffles) and a <i>soup�on</i> of romance, <i>Black Diamond</i> is a deliciously entertaining concoction that delivers all the complexity and delights of the Dordogne itself.</p><p><b>Martin Walker</b> is senior director of the Global Business Policy Council and editor in chief emeritus and international affairs columnist at United Press International. His previous Bruno novels, <i>Bruno, Chief of Police</i> and <i>The Dark Vineyard,</i> were published to international acclaim. He lives in Washington, D.C., and the southwest of France.<br><br>www.brunochiefofpolice.comChapter 1<br><br>There were not many times that Bruno Courr�ges disliked his job. But today was certainly one of them. The weather was not to blame, a crisp day in late November with thin, high clouds trailing feebly across a sky that was determined to be blue. And even this early in the morning the sun was warm on his face and lending a rich gold to the few remaining leaves on the line of old oaks that fringed the town's rugby field. It gave warmth to the aged stone of the mairie across the river and to the red tile roofs of the houses that climbed the hillside. The season was still mild enough, he noticed, for the women to have thrown open their windows and the blue wooden shutters. Splashes of white and blue, stripes and floral patterns, adorned the townscape where they had heaped out bedding to air on the balconies, as their mothers and grandmothers had done before them. It might be the last day of the year that would be possible. A touch of frost had silvered the grass outside his cottage when Bruno walked his dog just after dawn that morning, and he had heard the first of the Christmas Muzak in the supermarket over the weekend.<br><br>Bruno turned back to the scene before him, the small crowd waiting outside the silent sawmill, its chimney no longer sending plumes of smoke into the clear sky. The forklift trucks that usually scurried like beetles around the warehouses under their loads of timber were all parked neatly in their garage. The air still carried the wholesome scent of fresh-cut wood. But the memory would soon fade, since this was the day that the sawmill, one of the biggest and oldest employers in St. Denis, was to close its doors.<br><br>Bruno himself, acting under orders, had two weeks earlier delivered the formal notice of closure from the prefecture, citing the legal judgment against Sci�rie Pons and its owner for breach of the new rules on pollution in urban areas. As the town's only policeman, Bruno had tied a copy of the order, wrapped in plastic against the weather, to the sawmill gates. Now he had to stand watch as the law took its solemn course and the court ruling was carried out. And of course he was obliged to deal with whatever ill feeling followed from this long- running feud between the jubilant Green Party and the man they called "the arch-polluter of St. Denis."<br><br>"Pons out, Pons out," chanted the crowd, led into a chorus by a handsome man with a bullhorn, an expensive leather jacket and a white silk scarf. His long blond hair was tucked into a neat ponytail, and he wore a large Green Party button on his lapel. The posters the crowd carried explained the closure. There had been no economic calamity, no financial embarrassment, no sudden shortage of timber that the woods and forests of the Dordogne region had produced for centuries. There was no shortage of demand for the oak and chestnut, pine and hemlock. Indeed it was known that Boniface Pons, the owner of the sawmill that had been in his family for generations, was simply shifting his entire enterprise to another commune with wide forests and fewer than two hundred voters, where he had been assured there would be none of the angry demonstrations and the endless lawsuits that had driven him from St. Denis.<br><br>At last, our children can breathe, read one of the posters, which made Bruno roll his eyes at the exaggeration. He had played countless hours of rugby on the nearby playing field and endured dozens of training sessions while the chimney still spouted and never felt out of breath.<br><br>Environment 1-pons 0, read another poster, which for Bruno was closer to the truth. Pons's sawmill had, over the decade of Bruno's time as the town's policeman, installed two separate sets of scrubbing equipment for the steam and smoke that belched from the tall chimney. Each installation was supposed to be the latest in clean-air technology, yet within a few years each had been overtaken by new pollution directives from the European Union in Brussels. The most recent directive, which required any business with a polluting chimney to be a minimum distance from the nearest housing, had been the final straw for Boniface Pons. It was not his fault, Pons maintained, that the commune of St. Denis had decided, years before the latest directive had been thought of, to erect a block of cheap flats for public housing just one hundred and fifty feet from the fence around his sawmill. But with the new regulation, that meant his business was twenty-five feet inside the limit required by the EU.<br><br>"I've had enough of this green crap," Pons had announced at the last, heated council meeting. "If you don't want the jobs I bring and the two hundred thousand euros I pay in taxes to this town's budget every year, then fine. I'll go where my jobs are wanted."<br><br>Bruno had hoped to avoid trouble this morning, wishing that Pons would leave his building, lock his gates and make a dignified departure while the crowd of �colos, the town's environmental activists, calmly relished their victory. But from the gossip in the caf�s and the grumbling around the market stalls, he had known that the closure might not go so smoothly. He had discussed with the mayor, G�rard Mangin, whether they should call on the gendarmes for reinforcements. But the moment they envisaged Capitaine Duroc blundering his way in, they had dropped the idea. Had Duroc been away on a course, and the gendarmes under the experienced command of Sergeant Jules, their presence might have been a sensible precaution. As it was, the mayor and Bruno knew they could count only on themselves and on the years of trust they had built with their neighbors.<br><br>The crowd was bigger than Bruno had expected, swollen by curiosity and perhaps also by a sense that an era was passing and that history was finally overtaking the timber industry that had sustained St. Denis for centuries. Through wars and revolution, through boom times and recessions, the trees had always provided wine barrels and the boats that carried them; beams and floorboards and furniture for half the homes of France; desks in the schoolrooms and fires in the grates. Walnut trees provided oil and food and the young green fruit that produced the local vin de noix. Within living memory, in the hard times of Vichy and the German occupation, chestnut trees had even provided flour to make a kind of bread.<br><br>So the closure of a sawmill was much more than simply a matter of jobs for the people of St. Denis, Bruno reflected, as he watched knots of pensioners shuffle up the road from the retirement home. The oldest, Rosalie Prarial, the last inhabitant of the town who claimed to remember seeing young men going off to the final battles of the Grande Guerre in 1918, was being helped along by Father Sentout. Like many of the other pensioners, Rosalie had worked at the sawmill all her life, starting under Boniface's grandfather. Montsouris, the town's only Communist councillor, must have taken the day off from his job as a train driver, for he and his even more radical wife were approaching, followed by a delegation from the town's chamber of commerce. Bruno raised his eyebrows; it was a rare event that brought the left and the town's small businessmen together in common cause.<br><br>Half the town appeared to be gathering for the event, and Bruno suspected that most of them would be unhappy at this triumph of the Greens. But he knew his townsfolk to be on the whole levelheaded and law abiding, and while any such assembly brought the prospect of trouble, they were not lined up in opposition but gathered in separate knots and groups. A bit like a funeral, thought Bruno, when people hung back on the outskirts in deference to the family.<br><br>The mayor stood under the trees that guarded the rugby field, deliberately keeping his distance from the crowd and the sawmill gates. Beside him stood the baron, the main landowner in the district who was also Bruno's tennis partner. Albert, the chief of the town's fire brigade, was out of his customary uniform and smoking a pipe. A pickup truck lumbered around the corner from the public housing block, and Lespinasse, the local garage owner, clambered out with his sister from the florist's shop and his cousin from the tabac. They all shook hands with the mayor and his party and waved at Bruno.<br><br>Then the unmistakable clatter of an elderly Citro�n deux chevaux signaled the arrival of Pamela, the woman with whom Bruno was sometimes privileged to spend his nights. Few people now called her the Mad Englishwoman as they had at first, at least in Bruno's hearing. Indeed, now that residents from other European countries had been given the right to vote in France's local elections, the mayor had talked of running her for a council seat at the next election. The mayor hoped to secure the foreigners' votes, but it was a sign that Pamela was accepted as a daughter of St. Denis.<br><br>Despite his pleasure at seeing her and the bright smile she beamed at him, Bruno bit back a surge of irritation at Pamela's arrival. It was less that her presence would be a distraction, and more that he felt self-conscious at playing his public role under her gaze. Usually he rather enjoyed Pamela's teasing and the slightly mocking attitude the British seemed to adopt toward their police, but he was beginning to feel nervous about the way the crowd was building.<br><br>He sized up the situation. Other than scattered knots of spectators, the crowd was splitting into two camps. Opposite the main gates of the sawmill were the �colos, and at the front of the crowd that flanked them were young women with carriages and strollers. Some of them Bruno knew well, the wives and infants of the men who worked at the sawmill, men who now faced unemployment until Pons's new plant was ready. The women, glaring at the chanting �colos, had gathered by the small side gate their husbands used. Touching the peak of his cap, Bruno strolled across to greet them and to tousle the hair of the toddlers. He'd danced with the mothers at the feast of St. Jean and taught the younger ones to play tennis; he had attended their weddings and the baptisms of their children, hunted and played rugby with their fathers.<br><br>"A sad day," he said to Axelle as her twin daughters peeked out at Bruno from behind her skirts.<br><br>"Bloody �colos, always putting their noses into other people's business," she snapped. "How come the law doesn't look after people like us for a change?"<br><br>"Emile will be back at work soon," Bruno said, hoping to sound reassuring. "And I hear you got a job at the infants' school. I suppose Emile's mother can look after the kids."<br><br>"Lucky for some," sniffed another of the mothers. "There's no job for me, and whatever Pierre gets today will be the<br><br>last money we see for a while. It's going to be a pretty thin Christmas."<br><br>"I hope you're satisfied, you bastards!" Axelle shouted at the �colos. "Our kids will be going hungry because you keep whining over a whiff of smoke."<br><br>"Pons out, Pons out," the Greens chanted back, led by the dashing man with the bullhorn. To Bruno, he was the strangest feature of this drama, a long-lost son of St. Denis, home from his years of travel with a brand-new Porsche convertible, enough money to buy an old farm and convert it into a restaurant and exotic tales of life in Hong Kong, Bangkok and Singapore. And he had returned with an evident interest in local politics, a passionate commitment to the Green cause and an eagerness to fund the lawsuit that had finally succeeded in winning an order for the closure of his father's sawmill. For the young man was Guillaume Pons, who insisted that everyone should call him Bill, and seemed intent on pursuing his family feud against his estranged father by any available means.<br><br>Bruno wandered back to the crowd of chanting �colos and tapped Guillaume's shoulder.<br><br>"Do you think you could stop the chanting for a while? The women over there are worried about their men losing their jobs and they're getting upset. It won't help if you<br><br>rub their noses in it."<br><br>"I know, it's not their fault. But it's not ours either," Guillaume said pleasantly. As he put down the bullhorn to answer Bruno the chanting died away. "We just want clean air, and we could create clean jobs as well, if we put our minds to it."<br><br>Bruno nodded and thanked him for the pause in the chanting. "Let's keep this calm and dignified. It's a sad day for some, and we don't want tempers raised when the men come out."<br><br>"Perhaps the mairie should have thought of that when this campaign began, instead of using our tax money to subsidize the sawmill," Guillaume countered.<br><br>"We can all be wise after the fact," Bruno said. The last time Pons had threatened to close his sawmill, Bruno and the mayor had managed to scrape up some funds from the town's budget to help pay for the scrubbing equipment. It had gained them four years, until the new directive came in. The sawmill's four extra years of taxes had more than repaid the modest subsidy.<br><br>"Right now, I'm just concerned that we don't have an angry shouting match," Bruno added. "You're the one with the bullhorn, so I'm holding you responsible."<br><br>"Don't worry," Guillaume replied with a smile that in other circumstances Bruno might have found charming. He put a hand on Bruno's arm. "I can also use the bullhorn to calm them down. They'll listen to me."<br><br>"Let's hope so, monsieur." Bruno moved on to greet Alphonse, the elderly hippie from the commune in the hills above the town, and the first Green to have been elected to the town council.</p><h2>Soft and Others: 16 Stories of Wonder and Dread</h2><p>Presents a collection of horror short stories, among them &#34;Soft,&#34; &#34;Green Winter,&#34; and &#34;The Cleaning Machine&#34;</p><p></p><h2>No Carrots for Harry!

In under two minutes, the Mayor had us up on horseback, Morpeth and Angharrad coming running from round the back of the ruins of the cathedral, and by the time we'd hopped up, stepping over the still unconshus bodies of the men who tried to help me overthrow the Mayor, there was the army taking messy shape in front of us.<br><br>Not all of it, tho, maybe less than half, the rest still stretched up along the southern road to the hill with the notch on it, the road to where the battle was sposed to be.<br><br>Angharrad's thinking and I can feel spikes of nerves all thru her body.

"It's a thing of beauty, isn't it?" I point my rifle at him, the rifle I took from Davy. <br><br>"You just remember our agreement," I say.

The habitat proves to be much more than just a place that's "squishy under boots," as a young, raincoat-clad boy soon discovers. It catches rain for well water and prevents houses from washing away. In the autumn, it provides a nursery for young salmon. It is a hunting ground for herons, a hide-and-seek place for seed-searching mice. Its plants filter out pollution. Garter snakes and water striders glide by. A chorus of frogs blends with the song of a blackbird. A sudden rain releases the earthy scent of mud and decomposing plants. With fluid words and attractive illustrations, Squish! will inspire young readers to a greater appreciation of this valuable ecosystem.<br><i>Lisa Wu Stowe, Great Neck Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 4-7. A feast for the senses, <i>Squish!</i> provides young children with an introduction to the sights, sounds, and smells of a wetland as experienced by a young boy. Children are immersed in the imagery of a special place where newts, dragonflies, and water striders can be seen, the song of the blackbird and slap of the beaver's tail can be heard, and the pungent smell of rotting plants fills the air. Luenn uses simple language to explain some of the many ways wetlands are beneficial, and Himler's quiet watercolors beautifully capture the unusual, wondrous atmosphere. Youngsters previously unfamiliar with the wetland environment will gain not only a good understanding of the creatures and plants inhabiting the area, but also an appreciation of the importance of wetlands and the need for their preservation. <i>Lauren Peterson</i></p><h2>Had Enough?: A Handbook for Fighting Back</h2><p>The political consultant and best-selling author of We&#39;re Right, They&#39;re Wrong offers a definitive roadmap for freeing the country from influence peddling, war mongering, tax-cutting, environmentally devastating, hypocritical right-wing policies and politicians and outlines the problems--and solutions--for progressive Americans. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>Veteran political strategist James Carville has always had a knack for being concise. He is, after all, credited with coining "It's the economy, stupid" while directing the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton. And as host of CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, he favored a combative in-your-face approach that stood in stark contrast to the stereotype of the mushy liberal. In <i>Had Enough</i>, Carville, along with co-author Jeff Nussbaum, takes that economic phrasing and aggressive style to offer a handbook for lefties tired of losing arguments and elections. To point out how fundamentally misguided he believes the GOP to be, Carville goes straight to the preamble to the U.S. Constitution. While Republicans can be credited with providing for the common defense, Carville says, they have failed miserably on all other directives issued by the founding fathers on what government is supposed to do, including promoting the general welfare, establishing justice, ensuring domestic tranquility, and securing the blessings of liberty for ourselves and posterity. Although the arguments are not remarkably different from those made in a slew of other lefty books (Bush's tax cuts favor the rich, Republicans seek to curtail civil liberties), the book also offers "Had Enough" solutions to pressing issues of public policy that will come in handy for liberals looking to defeat a conservative brother-in-law in a political argument or even hold their own on <i>Crossfire</i>. These solutions always sound eminently reasonable, although that's due in large part to their being contrasted to Carville's interpretation of Bush and company's approach ("Use everything as an excuse to dig, drill, and burn.") Still, Carville and Nussbaum make a cogent, impassioned, and highly entertaining indictment of the Bush administration, which, combined with a smattering of incongruously placed but nonetheless tempting Cajun recipes, makes <i>Had Enough</i> a worthwhile read. <i>--John Moe</i><b>James Carville </b>is the best-known and most-loved political consultant in American history.

As a young man, he became well known, along with other writers in the OBERIU movement he founded, as an eccentric poet and performer of the early Soviet literary scene. He died of starvation incarcerated by the state on suspicion of Anti-Soviet activities. Matvei Yankelevich is a founding editor of Ugly Duckling Press. His translations and writings have appeared in numerous publications and anthologies. He teaches at Hunter College in New York City.In this surprising new collection of Soviet writer Kharms's short pieces, including poetry and journal entries (one of which appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i> earlier this month), readers will find echoes of Beckett, Ionesco and Kafka, among others. Indeed, Kharms (1905&#x2013;1942) was part the OBERIU (Association of Real Art), a Soviet artists' collective often described as Absurdist in orientation. A self-proclaimed member of the avant-garde, Kharms made often violent nonsense out of everyday life. In 1931, he was briefly exiled because his work did not promote Socialist Realism, as Yankelovich explains in an informative introduction. Kharms's life suffered a complete reversal after his return, a fact that shows in his writing. There's a youthful showiness to the earliest work that is replaced by a more fierce desperation in the later years, when Kharms often went hungry and knew his work would not be published. The book's wonderfully contradictory title, is in unexpected contrast to the weary resignation of a journal entry: Today I wrote nothing. Doesn't matter. Yankelovich, who provides the fine translations, makes much of the dramatic possibilities inherent in the work but almost combatively refuses to read any political meaning into his subject's writings, which alternate between playfulness and a sense of futility. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this diary, which she addressed to an imaginary friend called Kitty, Anne wrote about her life - first in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam and then, when the Nazi persecution of Jews forced her family into hiding, in the sealed-off back rooms of an Amsterdam office building, which they referred to as the &#39;Secret Annexe&#39;. Anne had always dreamed of being a writer and hoped one day to publish her diary.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>Tea-Cup Reading and the Art of Fortune-Telling by Tea-Leaves</h2><p>Tea leaves and fortune telling book.</p><p></p><h2>Muddle and Match: Monsters</h2><p>Imagine your own funny stories and create crazy characters as you flip through the split pages and muddle things up!</p><p></p><h2>Georgia Bonesteel&#39;s Bright Ideas for Lap Quilting</h2><p>Offers forty new designs from both traditional and contemporary styles, including full-size patterns and concise instructions</p><p></p><h2>Requiem for a People: The Rogue Indians and the Frontiersmen (Northwest Reprints (Paperback))</h2><p>A classic history of south-western Oregon&#39;s Rogue River Indian wars. Beckham strives to relate the Indian view of this tragic history, while identifying the cultural and ecological consequences of white settlement and mining.</p><p>Urling Coe came to the new town of Bend, Oregon, in 1905, a young medical school graduate seeking adventure and opportunity in the West. Frontier Doctor, Coe&#39;s autobiographical account of his thirteen-year residency, details the extraordinary experiences of a young physician in frontier Oregon and offers a vivid social history of town and ranch life on the Oregon high desert. His memoir also documents the development of a western town: with the arrival of the railroad in 1911, the wide-open settlement known as Farewell Bend was transformed into an important metropolitan center. In a new introduction historian Robert Bunting shows how Frontier Doctor adds to our understanding of the region&#39;s past and present. Coe&#39;s informed opinions and observations illustrate many of the newer topics in western history, such as conservationism, environmental change, the urban West, women and family issues, the West&#39;s multicultural character, and westerners&#39; ambivalent relationship with the federal government.Stephen Dow Beckham is Pamplin Professor of History at Lewis &amp; Clark College and the author of such books as "Requiem for a People: The Rogue Indians and the Frontiersmen" and "Many Faces: An Anthology of Oregon Autobiography," Doug Erickson is Head of Special Collections, Jeremy Skinner is an assistant archivist, and Paul Merchant is an editorial assistant, all at Lewis &amp; Clark College.</p><h2>No Bull: The Unauthorized Biography of Dennis Rodman</h2><p>Chronicling the life of this infamous basketball star, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times explores Rodman&#39;s childhood, rookie year playing with the Detroit Pistons, and his on- and off-court antics as one of the Chicago Bulls, the sport&#39;s reigning champs. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>It would probably take something the size of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> to fully explain the persona, the personality, and the phenomenon of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman, but Dan Bickley, a staff writer for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, at least gets a fast break on the explanation in <i>No Bull: The Unauthorized Biography of Dennis Rodman</i>. The Rodman that emerges from Bickley's search is intriguing, less a colorful clown of the court than a complex antihero who--from broken-home childhood to Madonna worship to photographer-kicking, wedding-dress-wearing rebounder extraordinaire--has lived his life above the rim and consistently marched to the sound of a drummer so different that no one else could even hear the beat. "I'm not a role model," Rodman readily admits, "I'm a figment of your imagination." In <i>No Bull</i>, that figment is fleshed out with some solid, three-dimensional reportage, interpretation, and analysis.Bickley, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times, offers an exasperated overview of the controversial Rodman's life, concentrating on the power forward's recent career and off-court hijinks. It's a brisk narrative, enlivened by quotes (many of them tackily highlighted in large type) from Rodman's colleagues and ertswhile friends. The problem is that those fascinated by Rodman's perpetual jousting with Chicago Bulls management, the cross- dressing, the very public affair with Madonna, and the on-court antics (head-butting an official, kicking a photographer) are likely to remain unswayed by Bickley's contention that Rodman, far from being out of control, has been deftly manipulating the media and fans, while those likely to agree with him would find this expos&#x201a; unnecessary.

The Zarn was a proud individual, and disliked intensely having to admit to any shortcomings or weaknesses. Certainly not being able to slumber was one such. Furthermore, he was going to have to seek aid from the Zarna, who had the temerity to lie peacefully next to him, snoring away contentedly. She had denied any number of times that she snored, and he had insisted with equal vigor that he, and not she, would be in a superior position to make such a determination. Such was the female's intransigence, however, that she refused to accept his word -- <i>his word</i> -- of this particular shortcoming of hers. Yet there she stubbornly lay, snoring blithely away. He wished, not for the first time, that there was a way to put an end to her snoring, and he further wished that he was not so besotted with her, even after all this time, that he could not bring himself to deal in any harsh manner with her. </p><p> The Zarn rolled over, studying the shape of her pale back, the jutting spine ridge exposed and alluring as ever. He ran his elegant fingers along it, not with a steady, brushing touch, but instead a series of light taps along the edges that he knew would rouse her, even in her sleep. Her hips twisted slightly with subconscious pleasure, and she made a little humming sound. "What are you doing?" she yawned thickly, but with the slightest sound of amusement in her voice. </p><p> "Nothing," replied the Zarn, sounding utterly innocent. He made no pretense of his own wakefulness, but instead simply lay there with his head propped on one hand. "I am doing nothing except regarding the magnificence that is your body." </p><p> "Mm-hmm," she said, in a tone that both managed to convey that she Was Not Amused, and yet simultaneously made him aware that she did, indeed, find it just ever so slightly funny. She wasn't looking at him, instead keeping the spine presented. It was a provocative decision, and she knew it to be so, but acted as if it wasn't. She managed to push the last vestiges of sleep from her voice. Her dark green eyes, solid and pupil-less, glowed in the darkness with that eerie luminescence so characteristic of the Aeron race. "All right, my husband...you have awakened me. Satisfied?" </p><p> "I? I intended no such thing," he assured her, sounding suitably stricken. He wasn't fooling her for a moment, of course, but after so many years together, they had developed little verbal rhythms that were as much a part of their union as sex or trust or anything else. "What sort of husband would I be if I thought I could disturb your much-needed rest whenever it suited my fancy?" </p><p> "You would be a ruling husband," she pointed out, "a Zarn, to be specific. And I would be your endlessly patient Zarna, wondering why she had been awakened while miraculously keeping a level tone." </p><p> He touched the fluttering membrane at the base of her throat in a vaguely suggestive manner, but she gently pushed his hand away. "Enough of that," she said firmly. "You did not rouse me from a perfectly sound slumber simply to feign interest in play." </p><p> "It's hardly feigned." </p><p> "Perhaps," she allowed, "but neither is it your concern. I know you too well." She now sat up, curling her knees to just under her chin. "Speak to me of what is <i>truly</i> on your mind." </p><p> "If you know me as well as you claim, then you should know without my having to tell you." </p><p> "Very well," said the Zarna evenly. "You're worried about our eldest son." </p><p> The Zarn looked at her with open admiration. "I am well and truly impressed," he admitted. </p><p> "It was not that impressive a feat, much as I would like to pretend otherwise." All of the banter, the teasing amusement in her voice had given way to seriousness. She was nude in bed next to her husband, and yet one would have thought from her deportment that she was fully robed and gowned, and seated in her Place of Discernment in the main court- room. "The relationship between you and the Zarnon has become more strained with each passing day. The Zarnon is no fool. He knows that you are disappointed in him." </p><p> "My disappointment arises from his own conduct and my judgment thereof." The Zarn swung his legs out of the gentle liquid bubble that served as their bed and stepped onto the floor. Even in the warmth of the Palace, the coldness of the night could be felt in the air. He slid his feet into slippers that sat near the edge of the bed, and pulled on his dressing gown, which hung nearby. His wife, the Zarna, clearly preferred the warmth of the liquid bed, and made no move to exit it. "He knows his duties, and appears unable to live up to them. In theory, he is to become Zarn after me...." </p><p> "In theory," the Zarna pointed out. "But to the Zarnon, it is not quite as easy as all that." </p><p> "Why not?" demanded the Zarn with irritation. "He is given the best of everything. The best teachers, the best training. All his young life, he has been provided every opportunity to live up to that which is his birthright. He should be proud. Instead he...seems to resent me. I do not understand." </p><p> "Tell me, my husband," the Zarna said slowly, apparently aware that she was treading on delicate ground. "How did you feel...about your own father?" </p><p> The Zarn shrugged indifferently. "I felt nothing for him one way or the other. He was my father and taught me my duty. I lived up to it. I ask nothing more of my own son." His pale face flushed with slight annoyance. "Are you now claiming that I have been an inadequate father? For if you are, I cannot help but take offense. I have labored mightily to be a far better father to the Zarnon than ever my father was to me." </p><p> "And you have succeeded," she assured him soothingly. "There is a very close bond between you and your son...deeper, perhaps, than even you know or understand. And in that bond may lie the problem." </p><p> He stared at her blankly. "I do not follow." </p><p> "All of the duties for which he is trained," she explained, "are predicated upon one thing: his assuming your duties after you are no longer capable of doing so, either because of incapacitation or death. Apparently our gentle son does not desire to dwell on such things." </p><p> The Zarn was not a stupid person, and even though it took him a few moments to process what the Zarna was saying to him, in time he finally understood. "He does not wish to dwell on my passing." </p><p> She nodded. "That is exactly right." </p><p> He stood in the middle of the dimly lit room. It was ornately furnished with many ceremonial trappings from the long line of Zarns who had preceded him in office: robes and headdresses and similar adornments, all carefully mounted and labeled with gleaming plaques beneath them. It had never occurred to the Zarn that being part of that line was not the greatest honor that any creature could hope for. He had often said that death held no terror for him, for in many ways he was already immortal. No matter what happened, he would join the line of illustrious Zarns who had overseen the fortunes of the planet Aeron, a marvelous little globe of blue and green hanging in the depths of what had once been called Thallonian space. It now appeared, though, that his successor, the Zarnon, felt differently. </p><p> The reality of it was a good deal for the Zarn to take in all at once. He eased himself down onto the edge of the bed, shaking his head. "I find that...difficult to believe...." </p><p> "Why so difficult? You have worked hard to be a caring and supportive father. The Zarnon wants only to please you, to gain your approval. And yet his greatest opportunity to do so can only occur after you are in no position to grant that approval. He is conflicted and frustrated. To his mind, he is being groomed for a position, for a duty, that will commence with failure. You will not be able to tell him that he is a good Zarn, nor will he be able to show you what he is capable of." </p><p> "He has overanalyzed the situation," the Zarn said, but he sounded a bit uncertain, and that was most unusual for him. He loathed any hint of uncertainty; he would rather make a wrong decision quickly than a considered decision slowly. "He has created in his mind a no-win scenario. That is hardly worthy of a ruler." </p><p> "He is <i>not</i> the ruler. Titles such as 'Zarnon' aside, he is simply a frustrated young man who wants to make his father proud, and has no true idea how to go about doing so." </p><p> "Well, what would you suggest...?" </p><p> "I am but the humble Zarna. You are our esteemed ruler. It is for you to decide." </p><p> He had no ready answer. He simply lay back on the bed, still in his dressing gown, his hands behind his head. He considered the matter for a considerable length of time, during which his wife's steady breathing did little to convince him that she had gone to sleep. When he finally spoke again, it was half an hour later. "I know what you are suggesting." </p><p> "Do you?" she said with amusement in her voice, making no pretense of having been slumbering. </p><p> "You do not fool me in the least." </p><p> "I don't?" Her tone had not changed. </p><p> "You are suggesting that I retire as Zarn. That I step aside and hand the office over to the Zarnon." His eyes narrowed as he spoke, and he did not sound any too pleased at the notion. </p><p> "I have suggested no such thing," replied his wife. </p><p> "Zarns retire when they are incapacitated. When they are unfit and unable to serve in the office." </p><p> "That is true," she allowed, but then added after a moment's thought, "However, that is not any sort of a rule. Merely a custom...and an unfortunate one at that." </p><p> "Unfortunate?" He was thunderstruck. The Zarna had always been second-to-none when it came to respect for traditions on Aeron. "Why unfortunate?" </p><p> "It is not my place to -- " </p><p> "Bellanaria," he said abruptly. </p><p> It brought her up short. The Zarna could not remember the last time he had addressed her by her true name. It made her realize just how much they had lost sight of that which they once were, and instead become simple extensions of their offices. Perhaps, she mused, that was part of the problem. As parents they knew what was right and true, almost instinctively. As Zarn and Zarna, every decision they made had to factor in what was best for the world of Aeron. </p><p> He had spoken sharply, and when he repeated the shortened version of her name, a more gentle "Bell," it was with as much compassion as he was capable of mustering. "Bell...why do you say it's unfortunate?" </p><p> Normally the Zarn did not like to hear anything against the traditions of their world, but it was quite clear to the Zarna that he was making an exception this time. She knew she had to speak as carefully as possible; who knew how long his mood would last? "Well," she said after several moments' consideration, "you really need look no further than the history of our world, do you? The beginning of a young Zarn's reign is always fraught with difficulties. Skirmishes, wars always seem to break out, until such time as the new Zarn gets a more secure grip on his people." </p><p> "Isn't that unavoidable, though? No matter how carefully a successor may be trained, there still has to be a time for him to learn, correct?" </p><p> "Yes, but look who he learns from: those who were advisors to the Zarn before him. Advisors who always seemed to act in the best interests of the Zarn and Aeron while the Zarn was alive...but once the Zarn they initially served passes, they always strive to grab whatever personal power they can. It happens time after time, and each Zarn, later in his career, appoints people who he thinks won't fall prey to such self-serving motivations. Yet it recurs. Such is Aeron nature, I suppose." </p><p> "And what would you suggest," he asked, "to break this cycle?" But he said it with the air of someone who knew the answer before he asked the question. </p><p> She took a deep breath, feeling as if she were launching herself off a precipice. "Step aside for your son. Instead of ruling as Zarn, be content to serve in an advisory capacity." She saw the expression on his face then, which spoke volumes in its silence. It seemed to say, <i>You think I'm not doing the job. You've lost faith in me.</i> It almost broke her heart to see that in him, and she made certain to keep a tone of love, affection, and respect uppermost in her voice. "You would not be driven by desire for power, because you would already have walked away from power, set it aside willingly. Other advisors and chancellors will not attempt to foist their own agendas upon the Zarnon...I'm sorry, the new Zarn. You will be able to guide the young Zarn in the ways of his office. Help give him the sort of on-the-job training that is the only way a new Zarn can truly come to understand his duties. As opposed to previous Zarns, who have always had to weigh the self-interest of their advisors into decisions, the new Zarn will be able to trust you -- his father -- implicitly. And in turn, it will give him the opportunity to show you what he can do. To earn your respect, your approval, while you are still here to give it." </p><p> "And when he has no need of me?" asked the Zarn. "Sooner or later, my presence will cease to be a comfort, and instead be a shadow that he cannot escape. That is certainly not desirable." </p><p> "When that time comes," she replied readily, "why... </p><p> then you will just have to focus your attention on the rest of your family. We do have other sons, as well as two daughters. And a wife...a wife who enjoyed hearing you speak her true name just now." She stroked his arm, gently, adoringly. "A wife who would very much appreciate the opportunity to have you all to herself. Sometimes when I climb into bed with you, I feel as if I'm here with the entire population of Aeron, for your attention is split in so many directions at once. If, on the other hand, it were just us, oh, the pleasure that would bring me. And for that matter, the pleasure I could bring you..." She let her voice trail off, but there was a teasing look on her face. </p><p> "You present a very...compelling argument," he said after a time. He had been propping himself up on one elbow, watching her as she had spoken, and she'd felt as if that gaze were boring deep into her soul, dissecting her molecule by molecule. Then, to her utter astonishment, he said, "I will do it." </p><p> "What?" she managed to get out. "You...you don't wish to discuss something of such importance with..." </p><p> "With others? Those who might feel disenfranchised, or believe that I am making decisions based on lack of trust in their abilities? No, I see no need to discuss it with them." He was nodding, although it seemed more to himself than to anyone else. "I am the Zarn. I am the leader of the Aeron. I am the one who makes the decisions, and once a decision is made, I see no reason at all to consult others. The things you've said to me make infinite sense; why should I waste time discussing the matter with those who will make less sense? Or who will strive to explain to me why you are wrong? I do not think you are wrong, and furthermore, if you ...</p></p><h2>A Wilderness Within: The Life of Sigurd F. Olson</h2><p>Olson is best known for his many essays that express the wonder, awe, and peace he found in the wilderness. Olson's popular books, including The Singing Wilderness, Listening Point, and Reflections from the North Country, are beloved by generations of readers, and frequently appeared on best-seller lists across the nation. The lyricism and evocative beauty of his prose became a model for nature writers like Barry Lopez and Annie Dillard. Olson was a recipient of the John Burroughs Medal, the highest honor in nature writing.<br>A Wilderness Within looks beyond the environmental battles and books to reveal the inner forces that drove Sigurd Olson. Backes details Olson's painful path to becoming a writer, and the physical and emotional toll that his activism and writing took from him. For this biography, Backes conducted interviews with Olson's family and had complete access to Olson's papers, diaries, correspondence, and photographs.</p><p>This well-balanced assessment of Sigurd Olson (1899-1982) pays as much attention to his spiritual quest as to his activism in defense of America's natural resources with such groups as The Wilderness Society and the National Parks Association. Olson found a sense of completeness while hiking, canoeing, and hunting in the northern Midwest. He conveys these feelings in influential books such as <i>The Singing Wilderness</i>, which inspired a generation of younger nature writers. David Backes, who knew Olson in his later years, captures his personality and evaluates his achievements in lucid prose.Backes (Canoe Country: An Embattled Wilderness, not reviewed) knits together a yeomanly portrait of Olson, a force in the mid-20th-century environmental movement, but someone today's readers may find a bit of a dinosaur. Olson will best be remembered for authoring such conservationist hymnals as The Singing Wilderness and Reflections from the North Country, where he vented his land aesthetics and spiritual beliefs. His ego was such that, after reading Thoreau, he felt ``no one has as yet developed a philosophy of the wilderness. That is up to me.'' And it is to the credit of Backes--an unabashed Olson fan who treats his papers and diaries as if they were sacred relics--that he includes such nuggets. The son of a strong-willed Swedish Baptist minister, Olson evolved a kind of wilderness theology--a love of all life in God's cosmic adventure--that found ``ritualistic significance'' in the uncivilized world. These days, Olson's writing feels by turns overly manly (``My work must be strong and hard and masculine'') and overly sentimental; readers may well agree with the Houghton Mifflin editor who rejected Olson's first collection: ``Essays . . . have to be superbly written to have a chance, and Sig Olson's prose is not on that level.'' Thus Backes wisely devotes significant space to Olson's championing such then-crazy notions as roadless areas and air reservations (patches over which no flights are allowed) and to making sense of a man who bridled at the thought of being behind a desk, who would rather have been in a canoe, yet accepted numerous administrative posts, from college dean to president of the Wilderness Society, with many a bureaucratic stop between, hating them all the while. Impeccably researched, near-claustrophobically detailed, evenhanded--Backes's volume gives a sense of the Olson behind the legend. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The world sees a glorious future for this sleeping giant, three times larger than the United States, predicting it will blossom into the world's biggest economy by 2010. According to Chang, however, a Chinese-American lawyer and China specialist, the People's Republic is a paper dragon. Peer beneath the veneer of modernization since Mao's death, and the symptoms of decay are everywhere: Deflation grips the economy, state-owned enterprises are failing, banks are hopelessly insolvent, foreign investment continues to decline, and Communist party corruption eats away at the fabric of society. <br><br>Beijing's cautious reforms have left the country stuck midway between communism and capitalism, Chang writes. With its impending World Trade Organization membership, for the first time China will be forced to open itself to foreign competition, which will shake the country to its foundations. Economic failure will be followed by government collapse. Covering subjects from party politics to the Falun Gong to the government's insupportable position on Taiwan, Chang presents a thorough and very chilling overview of China's present and not-so-distant future.</p><p>From 1978 through the mid-1990s, China had the fastest-growing economy in the world, and it appeared poised to dominate Asia, and beyond, in the near future. But after focusing on facts rather than theory and looking at the conditions behind the spectacular numbers, Gordon Chang presents the People's Republic as a study in wasted potential: "Peer beneath the surface, and there is a weak China, one that is in long-term decline and even on the verge of collapse. The symptoms of decay are to be seen everywhere." For a nation that has always taken a long view of history, time is quickly running out. Chang believes China has about five years to get its economy in order before it suffers a crippling financial collapse--a timeline he seriously doubts can be met.<p> By failing to complete its reformation, China has maintained an illusion of progress, Chang explains, but in reality has caused more problems than opportunities for would-be entrepreneurs and foreign investors. Because reform has not been fast enough or comprehensive enough, China is unable to benefit from its modernization or keep up technologically with much of the world. The government's reluctance to get rid of state-owned enterprises has not only rendered China uncompetitive just as it prepares to join the World Trade Organization, but is causing the banks--which were forced to lend money to SOEs--to fail alongside them. Widespread unemployment, corruption within the Communist party, millions of resentful peasants, and a general lack of leadership further threaten stability. The Communist party "knows how to suppress but it no longer has the power to lead," Chang writes, arguing that the party is maintaining control only through the use of brute force and the people's instinct for obedience--popular support that could deteriorate as soon as the economy plunges. Simultaneously, societal ills such as gambling, drugs, and prostitution have become huge problems.</p><p> Stuck between Communism and capitalism, "China is drifting, unwilling to go forward as fast as it must and unable to turn back." It is uncertain what will be in the way when the giant finally falls. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>"A compelling account of the rot in China's institutions and the forces at work to end the Communist Party's monopoly on power." <br>-James A.

(Phil Jackson, lead pastor, The House, coauthor, The Hip-Hop Church)<br><br>"David Anderson addresses one of the real solutions to the issue of racism with this difficult practice of grace! David's take from an African American perspective enlightens us to how deep racism runs even in Christian institutions and relationships, but more than that, he also offers us a biblical initiative to lead us to the vision of being a community that reflects the diversity of God." (Dave Gibbons, lead pastor, NewSong Church, and CVO, Xealot Inc.)<br><br>"A tough-minded book and clear-sighted look at what it means for Christians to 'overcome evil with good.' If metaphor is metamorphosis, the metaphor of 'gracism' will change how we do church like it's changed how I do life." (Leonard Sweet, E.

An hour passes in silence and it occurs to him that he is tired and might as well go home, so he picks up his sword and walks toward his house, sure that whatever obstacles await will be minor compared to what he has been through.</p><p>The house looks much as it did when he left. He notices that the sheep byre&#x2019;s gate has been mended. A rivulet of smoke rises from the chimney. He steals lightly in, hand on sword, thinking how ridiculous it would be to come so far and lose everything in a moment of carelessness.</p><p>Within, Penelope is at her loom and an old man drowses by the fire. Odysseus stands in the doorway for a while before Penelope notices him and shrieks, dropping her shuttle and before she draws another breath running and embracing him, kissing him and wetting his cheeks with her tears. Welcome home, she says into his chest.</p><p>The man by the fire stands up looking possessive and pitifully concerned and in an intuitive flash Odysseus knows that this is her husband. The idea is absurd&#x2014;the man is soft, grey and heavy, no hero and never was one, would not have lasted an hour in the blinding glare before the walls of Troy. He looks at Penelope to confirm his guess and notices how she has aged&#x2014;her hips wider, her hair more grey than not, the skin around her eyes traced with fine wrinkles. Without the eyes of home-coming there is only an echo of her beauty. She steps back from him and traces a deep scar on his shoulder and her wonder and the old man&#x2019;s fear become a mirror&#x2014;he realizes that with his blackened skin, tangled beard and body lean and hard from years of war he looks like a reaver, a revenant, a wolf of the sea.</p><p>Willfully composed, Penelope puts her hand on his shoulder and says that he is most welcome in his hall. Then her face collapses into tears and she says she did not think he was coming back, had been told he was dead these last eight years, had given up a long time ago, had waited as long as she could, longer than anyone thought was right.</p><p>He had spent the days of his exile imagining different homecoming scenarios but it had never occurred to him that she would just give up. The town deserted, his house overrun by violent suitors, Penelope dying, or dead and burned, but not this. "Such a long trip," he thinks, "and so many places I could have stayed along the way."</p><p>Then, mercifully, revelation comes. He realizes that this is not Penelope. This is not his hall. This is not Ithaca&#x2014;what he sees before him is a vengeful illusion, the deception of some malevolent god. The real Ithaca is elsewhere, somewhere on the sea- roads, hidden. Giddy, Odysseus turns and flees the tormenting shadows.</p>2<br>&nbsp;THE OTHER ASSASSIN<br>&nbsp;In the Imperial Court of Agamemnon, the serene, the lofty, the disingenuous, the elect of every corner of the empire, there were three viziers, ten consuls, twenty generals, thirty admirals, fifty hierophants, a hundred assassins, eight hundred administrators of the second degree, two thousand administrators of the third and clerks, soldiers, courtesans, scholars, painters, musicians, beggars, larcenists, arsonists, stranglers, sycophants and hangers- on of no particular description beyond all number, all poised to do the bright, the serene, the etc. emperor's will. It so happened that in the twentieth year of his reign Agamemnon's noble brow clouded at the thought of a certain Odysseus, whom he felt was much too much renowned for cleverness, when both cleverness and renown he preferred to reserve for the throne. While it was true that this Odysseus had made certain contributions to a recent campaign, involving the feigned offering of a horse which had facilitated stealthy entry into an enemy city, this did not justify the infringement on the royal prerogatives, and in any case, the war had long since been brought to a satisfactory conclusion, so Agamemnon called for the clerk of Suicides, Temple Offerings, Investitures, Bankruptcy and Humane and Just Liquidation, and signed Odysseus's death warrant.<br>The clerk of Suicides etc. bowed and with due formality passed the document to the General who Holds Death in His Right Hand, who annotated it, stamped it, and passed it to the Viceroy of Domestic Matters Involving Mortality and so on through the many twists and turns of the bureaucracy, through the hands of spymasters, career criminals, blind assassins, mendacious clerics and finally to the lower ranks of advisors who had been promoted to responsibility for their dedication and competence (rare qualities given their low wages and the contempt with which they were treated by their well-connected or nobly born superiors), one of whom noted it was a death order of high priority and without reading it assigned it to that master of battle and frequent servant of the throne, Odysseus.&nbsp;A messenger came to Ithaca and gave Odysseus his orders. Odysseus read them, his face closed, and thanked the messenger, commenting that the intended victim was in for a surprise, and that he was morally certain no problems would arise on his end.&nbsp;On the eight succeeding days Odysseus sent the following messages to the court as protocol required:&nbsp;&#x201c;I am within a day's sail of his island.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I walk among people who know him and his habits.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I am within ten miles of his house.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Five miles.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I am at his gate.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The full moon is reflected in the silver mirror over his bed. The silence is perfect but for his breathing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I am standing over his bed holding a razor flecked with his blood. Before the cut he looked into my face and swore to slay the man who ordered his death. I think that as a whispering shade he will do no harm.&#x201d;<br><p></p><p>Excerpted from The Lost Books of The Odyssey by Zachary Mason.<br>Copyright � 2007, 2010 by Zachary Mason.<br>Published in 2010 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.<br>All rights reserved.

Describing the political effects of Original Sin, he shows how man's suppression of his knowledge of right and wrong corrupts his conscience and accelerates social collapse. The depraved conscience grasps at the illusion of "moral neutrality," the absurd notion that men can live together without a shared understanding of how things are. After evaluating the political devices, including the American Constitution, by which men have tried in the past to work around the effects of Original Sin, Dr. Budziszewski elucidates the pitfalls of contemporary communitarianism, liberalism, and conservatism. <p>The revenge of conscience is horrifically manifest today in abortion, euthanasia, and suicide, evils brought about by the pollution of good impulses such as pity, prudence, honor, and love. The way out of this confusion, he concludes, is Christianity, a once-prevalent faith whose troubling memory men now suppress along with their knowledge of the natural law. The political responsibility of Christians is somehow to stir up that memory and that knowledge, a daunting task in a world of sound bites and shouting matches.</p></p><p>J.

Bush presidency, the news media have utterly failed in their duty as watchdog for the public. In blistering prose, Eric Boehlert reveals how, time after time, the press chose a soft approach to covering the government, and as a result reported and analyzed crucial events incompletely and even inaccurately. From WMDs to Valerie Plame to the NSA's domestic spying, mainstream fixtures such as <i>The New York Times,</i> CBS, CNN, and <i>Time</i> magazine too often ignored the administration's missteps and misleading words, and did not call out the public officials who betrayed the country's trust. Throughout both presidential campaigns and the entire Iraq war to date, the media acted as a virtual mouthpiece for the White House, giving watered-down coverage of major policy decisions, wartime abuses of power, and egregious mistakes -- and sometimes these events never made it into the news at all.

Moreover, journalists -- who may have wanted to report accurately on the important stories -- often found themselves at cross-purposes with media executives, many of whom were increasingly driven by economic concerns.

One signal exception is the mainstream media, known in the blogosphere as the MSM -- the big commercial and cable TV networks, the major newspapers and the news magazines, all of which have taken a pounding from both right and left. <p>The latest to join in the pounding is Eric Boehlert, a contributing editor for Rolling Stone. "Battered by accusations of a liberal bias and determined to prove their conservative critics wrong," he argues in the bluntly titled Lapdogs, "the press during the run-up to the war -- timid, deferential, unsure, cautious, and often intentionally unthinking -- came as close as possible to abdicating its reason for existence in the first place, which is to accurately inform citizens, particularly during times of great national interest." With this for his central argument, Boehlert has written an important book, but one that probably will not be welcomed in newsrooms; journalists don't like scathing criticism any more than the rest of us. </p><p>Unfortunately, Lapdogs may be easy for some to write off: It has flaws that too often overwhelm the valuable research and provocative analysis that Boehlert has assembled, including material on subjects beyond Iraq ranging from the "press haters" on the right who seek to dismantle independent journalism to the question of how the 2004 campaign was covered. One obvious failing is that a book by a journalist attacking the press ought to have included some responses from editors and reporters who disagree with Boehlert's conclusions. There is basically none of that here.</p><p>Another defect is that Lapdogs too frequently appears overtly political; the book is written as though a cadre of Bill Clinton's defenders were its editors. Boehlert's case that a timorous press was intimidated by President Bush frequently rests on comparisons to the media's supposedly more aggressive approach to Clinton and former vice president Al Gore. This is arguable, at best, and the tactic diminishes the book's overall impact. Moreover, Boehlert reinforces this problem with an odd ending. "While the point of Lapdogs," he writes, "is to document the press's failings and not necessarily to offer Democrats communication or campaign strategies, it does seem obvious that if Democrats have to battle both entrenched Republicans as well as a MSM that refuses to give the party out of power a fair shake, then Democrats are going to continue to have trouble winning elections." It's not easy to be a credible media critic when you're also being, at least indirectly, a Democratic s!</p><p> trategist. </p><p>Moreover, the book starts out by waving another red flag. In the preface, Boehlert writes, "The goal of Lapdogs is to cut through incessant rhetoric about a liberal media bias, and to show, factually, just how the mainstream media has tipped the scales in President Bush's favor for going on six years. The proof for that is all in the public record; in the voluminous pages of the New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, and Time, just to name a few, as well as in the mountain of transcripts produced by network and cable news programs." Laying this out, he writes, "makes the conclusion -- that the press rolled over for Bush -- inescapable." But there is no way to prove that this is "inescapable," which would mean knowing what was inside the heads of producers and editors at the time their news decisions were made. </p><p>I firmly agree with Boehlert that the press was seriously derelict in its prewar coverage. (Indeed, he refers to some of my critical columns during my tenure as The Washington Post's ombudsman.) But topics such as Saddam Hussein's weapons programs were tough subjects to get at -- although U.S. newspapers ran quite a few good stories, produced by Knight Ridder's Washington bureau, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, among others. One big problem, however -- especially at this newspaper -- was that these challenging stories were far too often run inside the paper rather than on the front page. Other stories that challenged the whole premise of an invasion were simply missed or minimized.</p><p>So does that mean that the editors who made those calls were pro-Bush or cowed by the aftermath of Sept. 11, fiery right-wing bloggers, conservative broadcasters and a mean White House press strategy? Or did some editors simply exercise poor news judgment or lack the experience or determination to make sure that nothing was left unsaid, unchallenged or uncovered? Or were they convinced that a war with Iraq was coming and were too focused on getting ready to cover it?</p><p> I tend to chalk up uncritical reporting on administration claims about Iraq's supposed doomsday arsenal to that combination of factors. And of course, the obvious inference from Saddam Hussein's behavior -- his use of chemical weapons against Iranian troops and his own Kurdish civilians in the 1980s, his earlier nuclear arms ambitions, his bucking of the U.N. arms inspectors -- was that this was a regime with something to hide. But maybe something else was indeed going on in America's newsrooms. If so, Boehlert's book will prove to be the most well-researched and well-argued one I've yet seen about the darker side of why the press failed.</p><p> This book takes a hard look at TV, the news broadcasts as well as the big Sunday interview programs. Lapdogs provides many accounts where TV news divisions seemed to fall short -- for instance, by not asking the right questions (thereby giving policymakers a pass) or inviting the right guests (thereby stacking the deck with conservatives and hawks). It also questions the cozy relationships between some TV hosts and high officials. To their credit, several newspapers, including the New York Times -- which had the most to apologize for -- and The Washington Post, looked in the mirror afterward and reported on their own shortcomings. Television hasn't done that.</p><p> To anyone who has been following the press saga of the last six years, the episodes in this book -- from the Swift boats and Bush's National Guard service to Terri Schiavo, the Downing Street memo and the battle for more conservative views on PBS -- will be familiar. But Boehlert fills in several strokes that present a fuller portrait. The performance of the press during the Bush years, especially in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, is so important that all serious attempts to assess it are worthy of attention. Despite the flaws, this is one of them. </p><p>Reviewed by Michael Getler <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

The autobiographical <i>Brothers and Keepers</i>, however, allowed the writer to find his own voice. Perhaps this dual portrait of the author and his brother Robby--serving, then and now, a life sentence for a murder committed during a bungled robbery--finally forced Wideman to fuse the modernist trappings of his earlier work with the storytelling traditions of African American culture. "My memories needed his," the author recalls. "Maybe the fact that we recall different things is crucial. Maybe they are foreground and background, propping each other up." In any case, the <i>Rashomon</i>-like result is a raw meditation on fate and family, as well as an indictment of our entire notion of crime and (especially) punishment.&#34;Like the Russian master [Dostoevsky], Wideman probes the torment of the soul....[He] is fashioning some of the most powerful literature today.&#34;--U.S. News and World Report</p><h2>Hellhole (The Hellhole Trilogy)</h2><p><p>Only the most desperate colonists dare to make a new home on Hellhole.

The underdog, General Tiber Adolphus, had taken on the corrupted Constellation and lost as a direct result of choosing a moral high ground. The ruler of the Constellation, Diadem Michella Duchenet, does not have him executed but, rather, exiled permanently to a planet in the Deep Zone. The diadem is the powerful ruler of a system not unlike that of Louis XVI of France, a feudal system of nobility that tramples the common people for the benefit of the few scheming nobles at the topa system teetering at the end of its useful life. In the time-honored footsteps of story arcs like Star Wars and Dune, Adolphus continues to plan a rebellion from his remote world of exile, hoping to eventually achieve the Deep Zone planets independence from the Constellation. A brilliant strategist, lover of Old Earth history, and castoff of a now-defunct noble line, Adolphus is a Robin Hood for the galaxy to unite behind and support. The characters are easy for the reader to believe in, brought to life through not only their own emotions but also the responses and thoughts of the individuals around them. --Rebecca Gerber</p><h2>Midnight Farm</h2><p>On a hot summer night, two young brothers join a fantastical nighttime musical extravaganza by the plants and animals on their farm on Martha&#39;s Vineyard.</p><p>Late one summer night, twin boys wake to the sound of hoots and howls. Peering out their window they see a strange sight -- it may be time to sleep everywhere else, but on this Martha's Vineyard farm all of the animals and vegetables are just waking up and putting on thier clothes! A field mouse invites the boys to join in the midnight celebration, and they find themsleves caught up in a very different kind of nocturnal adventure. <p>Carly Simon's rollicking, rhythmic text is a delight to read aloud. Together with David Delamare's dreamlike illustrations it creates an imaginative fantasy that will capitivate readers.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2. Simon's inventive nighttime fantasy is set in a rural area of Martha's Vineyard. Under a melon-sized moon, pajamaed twin brothers cavort with a choir-directing tulip, a guitar-strumming apple tree, a mandolin-playing mouse, jitterbugging sheep, and chattering flamingos, while on the sidelines jauntily dressed cows applaud in appreciation. For the most part, Simon's words trip easily off the tongue, but, at times, readers will need to adapt their pronunciation to make the rhyme work ("The queen bee looked so mean/when we ran we got tangled/in her wide crinoline"). Delamare's acrylic illustrations, while well drafted and filled with precise detail, have an enameled look that seems a shade too harsh for a nocturnal adventure. Irene Haas's fanciful and delicately rendered A Summertime Song (McElderry, 1997) offers a more dreamlike reverie; however, children liking a large dollop of wackiness in their fantasies will enjoy the fun this duo provides.?Barbara Elleman, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode in the American Civil War and the Veteran, Classic Library</h2><p>An Episode in the American Civil War.</p><p></p><h2>High Tartary (Kodansha Globe)</h2><p>An insightful and recondite chronicle of a journey through Chinese Turkestan retracing the ancient routes that were once essential to world trade offers a rich and revealing portrait of one of the world&#39;s most unfamiliar and fascinating areas.

Beginning in 1921, a series of creative breakthroughs led Davis away from figurative painting and toward a more abstract expression of the world he inhabited. Drawing upon his admiration for C�zanne, L�ger, Picasso, and Seurat, Davis developed a style that would evolve over the next four decades to become a dominant force in postwar art. His visionary responses to modern life and culture both high and low remain relevant more than 50 years after his death. Focusing on the images and motifs that became hallmarks of his career, this book features approximately 100 works&#x2015;from his paintings of tobacco packages of the early 1920s, the abstract Egg Beater series, and the WPA murals of the 1930s, to the majestic works of his last two decades. The authors take a critical approach to the development of Davis's art and theory, paying special attention to the impact his earlier work had upon his later masterpieces. They also discuss Davis&#x2019;s unique ability to assimilate the lessons of Cubism as well as the imagery of popular culture, the aesthetics of advertising, and the sounds and rhythms of jazz&#x2015;his great musical passion. Informed by previously unpublished primary documents, the detailed chronology is, in effect, the first Davis biography. Together, these elements create a vital portrait of an artist whose works hum with intelligence and energy.</p><p>BARBARA HASKELL is Curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, NewYork. HARRY COOPER is Curator and Head of the Modern Art Department at theNational Gallery of Art, Washington, DC."This engaging analysis of Davis&#x2019;s place in abstraction and in American painting is an important addition to the literature on American art.

The pictures stand out in good, big reproductions, each on its own otherwise empty page. Haskell&#x2019;s essay on all aspects of Davis&#x2019;s career lucidly picks up the many strands, and Harry Cooper, writing on the painter&#x2019;s way of continually reworking his earlier pictures &#x2013; or making essentially an art about art- presents a Davis who is often lost sight of: an aesthete-engineer who could be entirely oblivious of his time and place. The highlight of this catalog, however, is a book-length chronology- at times going by the month, even the week- that Haskell has compiled. Her &#x201c;A Chronicle&#x201d; forms the fullest biography we have of the painter." <p>&#x2015;<i>New York Review Books</i></p></p><h2>The Chronicles of Narnia</h2><p>The Chronicles of Narnia have enchanted millions of readers over the last fifty years and the magical events described in C.S.

The Chronicles of Narnia have enchanted millions of readers over the last fifty years and the magical events described in C.S. Lewis&#39;s immortal prose have left many a lasting memory. For here is a world where a witch decrees eternal winter; where there are more talking animals than people; and where battles are fought by Centaurs, Giants and Fauns.</p><p><i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, by C.S.

In brief, four children travel repeatedly to a world in which they are far more than mere children and everything is far more than it seems. Richly told, populated with fascinating characters, perfectly realized in detail of world and pacing of plot, and profoundly allegorical, the story is infused throughout with the timeless issues of good and evil, faith and hope.

But most residents of Denmark and Sweden, he found, don&#x2019;t worship any god at all, don&#x2019;t pray, and don&#x2019;t give much credence to religious dogma of any kind. Instead of being bastions of sin and corruption, however, as the Christian Right has suggested a godless society would be, these countries are filled with residents who score at the very top of the &#x201c;happiness index&#x201d; and enjoy their healthy societies, which boast some of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world (along with some of the lowest levels of corruption), excellent educational systems, strong economies, well-supported arts, free health care, egalitarian social policies, outstanding bike paths, and great beer.<br>Zuckerman formally interviewed nearly 150 Danes and Swedes of all ages and educational backgrounds over the course of fourteen months. He was particularly interested in the worldviews of people who live their lives without religious orientation. How do they think about and cope with death? Are they worried about an afterlife? What he found is that nearly all of his interviewees live their lives without much fear of the Grim Reaper or worries about the hereafter. This led him to wonder how and why it is that certain societies are non-religious in a world that seems to be marked by increasing religiosity. Drawing on prominent sociological theories and his own extensive research, Zuckerman ventures some interesting answers.<br>This fascinating approach directly counters the claims of outspoken, conservative American Christians who argue that a society without God would be hell on earth. It is crucial, Zuckerman believes, for Americans to know that &#x201c;society without God is not only possible, but it can be quite civil and pleasant.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Phil Zuckerman </b>is the author of several books, including <i>What It Means to be Moral</i> (Counterpoint, 2019) <i>The Nonreligious</i> (Oxford, 2016), <i>Living the Secular Life</i> (Penguin, 2014), <i>Faith No More</i> (Oxford, 2012), and <i>Society Without God</i> (NYU, 2008), and the editor of several volumes, including <i>The Oxford Handbook of Secularism</i> (2016) and <i>The Social Theory of W.E.B. Du Bois</i> (2004). He is a Professor of Sociology at Pitzer College, and the founding chair of the nation&#x2019;s first Secular Studies Program. He blogs for <i>Psychology Today</i>. He lives in Claremont, California, with his wife and three children."In an anecdotal and eminently readable manner, Zuckerman offers a novel idea within the study of religious sociology." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Society without God is both a sociological analysis of irreligion and Zuckermans apologia pro vita sua. He wants us to know that, contrary to the deeply held beliefs of some Americans, a society without god can be a good society and an irreligious person can be a moral person, too. To his credit, Zuckerman provides enough nuance and detail to allow a skeptic like me to see what Peter Berger called &amp; signals of transcendence in the society without god he portrays. Along with the volumes engaging writing style, this makes it ideal for classroom use. I know my students will enjoy reading and discussing Society without God." (David Yamane,author of The Catholic Church in State Politics)<br><br>"Despite this books weighty topic, with its conversational writing style, Society Without God is amazingly readable, even fun. It presents rigorous arguments that are deceptively simple to understand, but that are, when you think about them more deeply, quite transformative." (<i>PopMatters</i>)<br><br>"Puts to rest the belief that you need God in order to be a moral person, that irreligious societies are wracked by social problems, and that godless people are unhappy and unmoored. . . . In the case of Scandinavia: God may be dead, but Swedes and Danes lead rich, full lives. Society Without God is a colorful, provocative book that makes an original contribution to debates about atheism and religiosity. Ideal for classroom use, it will get students thinking about their own lives and choices." (Arlene Stein,author of Shameless: Sexual Dissidence in American Culture)<br><br>"[Zuckerman] tells of a magical land where life expectancy is high and infant mortality low, where wealth is spread and genders live in equity, where happy, fish-fed citizens score high in every quality-of-life index: economic competitiveness, healthcare, environmental protection, lack of corruption, educational investment, technological literacy . . . well, you get the idea. Zuckerman (who has explored the sociology of religion in two previous books) has managed to show what nonbelief looks like when its &amp; normal, regular, mainstream, common. And hes gone at least partway to proving the central thesis of his book: &amp; Religious faithwhile admittedly widespreadis not natural or innate to the human condition. Nor is religion a necessary ingredient for a healthy, peaceful, prosperous, and . . . deeply good society." (Louis Bayard <i>Salon.com</i>)<br><br>"While never presuming to offer a strictly generalizable snapshot, by focusing his attention on what are probably the least religious countries in the world (2), his provocative and engagingly written book is very effective in helping readers to examine numerous assumptions concerning the place of religion in the modern world... The real strength of this book is that, by challenging widespread analytical assumptions, it presents us with more complexity and with more nuanced questions regarding the nexus of the religious and the secular in contemporary life. To quote a famous Dane on this very point, There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. If, as Horatio should have done, we are to heed these words in terms of expanding the frameworks of our accordingly, it will be due in good measure to paying attention to thoughtful and creative books like this one. In my estimation, not to do so would be, well, a tragedy." (<i>Sociology of Religion</i>)<br><br>"The book succeeds in documenting how the conditions of a liberal social welfare state promote contentment." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"For those interested in the burgeoning field of secular studies or for those curious about a world much different from the devout U.S.this book will offer some compelling reading." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Society Without God" offers a unique perspective on the active debate regarding the necessity of religion . . . By turning to one of the most secular societies in the world, Scandanavia, Phil Zuckerman offers an empirically grounded account of a successful society where people are happy and content and help their neighbors without believing in God. The book is fluently written and highly illuminating. It offers an accessible entry to important questions in the study of religion and secularism." (Michael Pagis <i>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</i>)<br><br>"Most Americans are convinced that faith in God is the foundation of civil society. Society Without God reveals this to be nothing more than a well-subscribed, and strangely American, delusion. Even atheists living in the United States will be astonished to discover how unencumbered by religion most Danes and Swedes currently are. This glimpse of an alternate, secular reality is at once humbling and profoundly inspiring and it comes not a moment too soon. Zuckermans research is truly indispensable."

Step by step, he blithely solves his technical problems and presents her with the book. She proclaims her joy and simultaneously hints at the future of his invention: "Open our shutters to the sun./ You shall make books for everyone." The verse is well composed and buoyant-but, as H. George Fletcher, curator at the Morgan Library, points out in a decidedly debunking afterword, it ignores rather than builds upon the historical record. There's no evidence that Gutenberg ever had a wife, and it took him many years to develop and use movable type. Meanwhile, Leister's atmospheric, attractively detailed Renaissance-style paintings don't benefit much from the pop-up frills; with the exception of a model printing press with movable parts, not much actually pops, and pull-tabs have little effect. Neither book lovers nor pop-up lovers will find much to romance them.

When a mysterious, charismatic stranger trudges into their snowy village with a frighteningly outlandish story to tell, its balance is shaken to the core.<br><br></p><p>James Meek has won several awards for his journalism and his fiction, but <i>The People's Act Of Love</i> is a singular departure from all that came before. It is a big Russian novel, written in English. Meek has upped the ante on such books as <i>Cold Mountain</i> and <i>The March</i> in bringing the reader his version of the unspeakable horror and brutality of war, the colder-than-cold winter, the cruelty and humanity of people in extremis. <p> It is 1919 in Yazyk, Siberia, far from anywhere. The war is waning, but its ravages remain. There is an uneasy detente between a group of Czech soldiers, marooned on the losing side and longing to go home, and a fanatical Christian sect that practices castration as a means of purifying themselves. One of their number is their leader, Balashov, married to a beautiful and restive photographer, Anna Petrovna, who has come to the village of Yazyk to raise her son, after learning of her husband's castration. Her fury knows no bounds. She gives herself to anyone who is interested as a means of shaming Balashov, and satisfying her own appetites. </p><p> Into this motley collection of people comes a stranger, Samarin, who says he has escaped from The White Garden, Russia's northernmost prison camp, a place of unbelievable barbarism. Shortly after his arrival, the village shaman, possessed of a third eye and an albino sidekick, is found murdered. Suspicion falls immediately on Samarin. In successive chapters, Meek has each person or faction tell his or her story. Samarin, a revolutionary, charismatic visionary, every bit as zealous as the castrates, tells of his escape. Matula, the crazy, cocaine-snorting leader of the Czechs, doesn't really want to go home, so he prevents his soldiers from leaving. Mutz, a sensible sort, quite taken with Anna, dreams of home and keeps hope alive among his soldiers. Balashov tells of what led him to castrate himself. </p><p> The hopes, wishes, dreams, and illusions of all these people converge in Meek's novel. He shows man as pure, base, megalomaniacal, rational, intelligent, incredibly stupid--every aspect of humanity is examined, especially compassion. Despite the horrid excesses of war--and peace--Meek, in their telling, weaves a completely believable story of what happens to people who are not just at the margins of the world, but at the edge of their ability to understand themselves and the world around them. (The people's act of love, by the way, has nothing to do with love: it is cannibalism.)

In this fifth suggested for mature readers trade paperback collection by acclaimed writer Brian Azzarello (HELLBLAZER, BATMAN/DEATHBLOW: AFTER THE FIRE), featuring art by Eduardo Risso (BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHTS) and a new cover by Dave Johnson, Agent Graves presents his trademark attach� case containing a gun and 100 untraceable bullets to Milo Garret &#x2014; a small-time private dick who's just gotten out of the hospital after losing an argument with his car's windshield. With his face covered in bandages, Milo has become an invisible man in more ways than one. As his latest case draws him into the shadowy world of the Trust, he's forced to confront the blank space that is his past and figure out what it has to do with the attach� case he's holding in the present... and do it before what he doesn't know ends up finishing the job that the windshield started.</p><p><b>Brian Azzarello</b> has been writing comics professionally since the mid-1990s. He is the author of <i>Jonny Double, Batman: Broken City</i>, and the Harvey and Eisner Award-winning <i>100 Bullets</i>, all created in collaboration with artist Eduardo Risso. Azzarello&#x2019;s other work for DC includes <i>Hellblazer</i> and <i>Loveless</i> with Marcelo Frusin; <i>Dark Knight III: The Master Race</i> with Frank Miller, Andy Kubert, and Klaus Janson; <i>Superman: For Tomorrow</i> with Jim Lee; <i>Joker</i> and <i>Luthor</i> with Lee Bermejo; <i>Sgt. Rock: Between Hell and A Hard Place</i> with Joe Kubert; <i>Filthy Rich</i> with Victor Santos; and most recently the all-new ongoing series <i>Wonder Woman</i> with Cliff Chiang.Set in a brutal world of tough guys and glamorous dames, the noir comic-book <i>100</i> Bullets revolves around a pulpy but potent premise: enigmatic Agent Graves offers wronged persons briefcases; each contains an untraceable gun and 100 rounds of ammunition, giving the recipient the means to avenge themselves and elude punishment. While depicting the fates of Graves' beneficiaries, the series has slowly parceled out information about the shadowy organization behind the agent. In this fifth collection (hence the tricky title), small-time PI Milo Garret learns from Graves that the automobile crash that left Garret with an Invisible Man-style bandaged face and holes in his past was no accident, and he decides it's payback time. The elegant simplicity of Risso's shadowy, atmospheric art perfectly suits Azzarello's sparse, hardboiled scripts; this is one of the most effective writer-artist teams in comics. Although sardonic, violence-addicted Garret is the focus here, characters from previous episodes reappear, keeping this from being the ideal entrance-point to the series. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This compilation includes 3 complete novels. HATCHET: This award-winning contemporary classic is the survival story with which all others are compared-and a page-turning, heart-stopping adventure, recipient of the Newbery Honor. Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson is on his way to visit his father when the single-engine plane in which he is flying crashes. Suddenly, Brian finds himself alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a tattered Windbreaker and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present-and the dreadful secret that has been tearing him apart since his parent&#39;s divorce. But now Brian has no time for anger, self pity, or despair-it will take all his know-how and determination, and more courage than he knew he possessed, to survive. DOGSONG: Something is bothering Russel Susskit. He hates waking up to the sound of his father&#39;s coughing, the smell of diesel oil, the noise of snow machines starting up. Only Oogruk, the shaman who owns the last team of dogs in the village, understands Russel&#39;s longing for the old ways and the songs that celebrated them. But Oogruk cannot give Russel the answers he seeks; the old man can only prepare him for what he must do alone. Driven by a strange, powerful dream of a long-ago self and by a burning desire to find his own song, Russel takes Oogruk&#39;s dogs on an epic journey of self-discovery that will change his life forever. TRACKER: For John Borne&#39;s family, hunting has nothing to do with sport or manliness. It&#39;s a matter of survival. Every fall John and his grandfather go off into the woods to shoot the deer that puts meat on the table over the long Minnesota winter. But this year John&#39;s grandfather is dying, and John must hunt alone. John tracks a doe for two days, but as he closes in on his prey, he realizes he cannot shoot her. For John, the hunt is no longer about killing, but about life</p><p></p><h2>Marion Mahony Griffin: Drawing the Form of Nature</h2><p>Chicago-born architect Marion Mahony Griffin (1871-1961) is known primarily for a magnificent drafting style that incorporated architectural plans into dramatic and stylized landscapes. Yet standard histories of early twentieth-century architecture have not fully recognized her pioneering work, which went far beyond her early contributions to the Prairie School. <i>Marion Mahony Griffin: Drawing the Form of Nature</i> is the first book devoted to Mahony Griffin's graphic work and presents a new critical interpretation of her art.<br><br>Marion Mahony Griffin was the second woman to graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in architecture and the first woman licensed to practice architecture in Illinois. After years of freelance drafting and design--most famously for Frank Lloyd Wright--she and her husband, architect Walter Burley Griffin, embarked on a career that catapulted them from Chicago to Australia in 1914 after winning the international competition to design the Federal Capital of Australia at Canberra. <br><br>Marion Mahony Griffin's graphic art is defined by her innovative representations of nature. Her presentation drawings clearly illustrate that architectural design and forms of the natural landscape are inseparable. Botanical forms are also woven into her children's book illustrations and murals and are the subject of the series of Forest Portraits she made in Australia. <br><br>The many illustrations in this book include vintage photographs of Mahony Griffin's life and work and commercial illustrations that have previously never been published, new photographs of her public murals, full-page color plates of her architectural renderings and Forest Portraits, as well as an exclusive color facsimile of the Forest Portraits and captions as found in the New-York Historical Society's copy of Marion Mahony Griffin's unpublished memoir "The Magic of America."<br></p><p>Debora Wood is senior curator at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University.

We visit cultures from Vedic India and Cleopatra&#39;s Egypt to Byzantium and the Elizabethan court; and meet an impressive cast of historic personages from Julius Caesar to Omar Khayyam, and giants of science from Galileo and Copernicus to Stephen Hawking. Our present calendar system predates the invention of the telescope, the mechanical clock, and the concept ol zero and its development is one of the great untold stories of science and history. How did Pope Gregory set right a calendar which was in error by at least ten lull days? What did time mean to a farmer on the Rhine in 800 A.D.? What was daily life like in the Middle Ages, when the general population reckoned births and marriages by seasons, wars, kings&#39;&#39; reigns, and saints&#39; days? In short, how did the world</p><p>In his latest book, David Ewing Duncan traces the development of our modern-day calendar and describes how people's experiences are shaped by their conception of time. Duncan postulates that all this concern with time started when a Cro-Magnon man decided to mark off the days of the lunar cycle on an eagle bone. After recounting the slow evolution of the calendar through the centuries, the author laments how time oriented our society has become: "There are moments when I am hopelessly late, or cannot possibly fit anything else into my schedule, when I sigh and wish that Cro-Magnon man 13,000 years ago in the Dordogne Valley had set aside his eagle bone and gone to bed." <p> The book is organized in chronological order and focuses mainly on the centuries leading up to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar (our modern calendar) by the Catholic Church in 1582. Along the way, Duncan describes the ancient calendars of many cultures all over the globe, from India to Egypt to the Mayan empire. During the Middle Ages, Christian churches discouraged scientific inquiry on the theory that it was wrong to question the nature of God's creation. This severely hampered the refinement of the calendar and the advancement of many academic pursuits. By the 16th century, Europe's calendars were 11 days out of sync with the solar year, which meant Easter was being celebrated on the wrong day. An infusion of knowledge from India and the Middle East helped Europeans get back on track. Duncan profiles the many mathematicians, philosophers, and monks who made organizing time their life's work. This book honors the efforts of those scholars and examines the way politics and religion influenced societal perceptions of time through the ages. <i>--Jill Marquis</i></p><p><strong>David Ewing Duncan</strong> is the author of five books, including the international bestseller <strong>Calendar</strong>, and writes for <em>Wired</em>, <em>Discover</em>, and <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>.

The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln&#x2019;s beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. &#x201c;My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,&#x201d; the president says at the time. &#x201c;God has called him home.&#x201d; Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy&#x2019;s body.<br><br>From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state&#x2014;called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo&#x2014;a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie&#x2019;s soul.<br><i><br>Lincoln in the Bardo</i>&nbsp;is an astonishing&nbsp;feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction&#x2019;s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we&nbsp;know that everything we love must end?<br><br>The 166-person full cast features award-winning actors and musicians, as well as a number of Saunders&#x2019; family, friends, and members of his publishing team, including, in order of their appearance: <br> &nbsp;<br> Nick Offerman as HANS VOLLMAN<br> David Sedaris as ROGER BEVINS III<br> Carrie Brownstein as ISABELLE PERKINS<br> George Saunders as THE REVEREND EVERLY THOMAS<br> Miranda July as MRS.

Now, let's see who answers the challenge.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Like the novel, the audiobook breaks new ground in what can be accomplished through a story. It helps that there&#x2019;s not a single bad note in the cast of a whopping 166 people. It&#x2019;s also the rare phenomenon of an audiobook being a completely different experience compared to the novel. Even if you&#x2019;ve read the novel, the audiobook is worth a listen (and vice versa). The whole project pushes the narrative form forward.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>A.V. Club</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;The result is an auditory experience unlike any other, where the awareness of individual voices disappears while the carefully calibrated soundscape summons a metaphysical masterpiece. This is a tour de force of audiobook production, and a dazzling realization of Saunders&#x2019; unique authorial structure.&#x201d;&#x2014;Booklist&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The finished audiobook&#x2019;s tapestry of voices perfectly mirrors the novel.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><b>Praise for George Saunders</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one writes more powerfully than George Saunders about the lost, the unlucky, the disenfranchised.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Saunders makes you feel as though you are reading fiction for the first time.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Khaled Hosseini</b><br><br>&#x201c;Few people cut as hard or deep as Saunders does.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Junot D�az</b><br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;George Saunders is a complete original.

If you can fight past an initial uncertainty about the identity of its narrators, you may find that it&#x2019;s the best thing you&#x2019;ve read in years. This first novel by acclaimed short-story-writer and essayist George Saunders (<em>Tenth of December</em>, <em>The Brain-Dead Megaphone</em>) will upend your expectations of what a novel should be. Saunders has said that &#x201c;Lincoln in the Bardo&#x201d; began as a play, and that sense of a drama gradually revealing itself through disparate voices remains in the work&#x2019;s final form. </p> <p>The year is 1862. President Lincoln, already tormented by the knowledge that he&#x2019;s responsible for the deaths of thousands of young men on the battlefields of the Civil War, loses his beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, to typhoid. The plot begins after Willie is laid to rest in a cemetery near the White House, where, invisible to the living, ghosts linger, unwilling to relinquish this world for the next. Their bantering conversation, much of it concerned with earthly -- and earthy &#x2013; pleasures, counterbalances Lincoln&#x2019;s abject sorrow. </p> Saunders takes huge risks in this novel, and they pay off. His writing is virtuosic &#x2013; and best of all, its highs and lows are profoundly entertaining. You may hear echoes of Thornton Wilder, Beckett and even a little Chaucer, but <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em> is peculiar and perfect unto itself. Some advice: don&#x2019;t try to read this one in a library. You&#x2019;ll be hooting with laughter when you aren&#x2019;t wiping away your tears. <em>--Sarah Harrison Smith, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>George Saunders</b> is the author of eight books, including the story collections <i>Pastoralia </i>and<i> Tenth of December, </i>which was a finalist for the National Book Award.

Like finding yourself a home owner in Italy, for example - though "home" may be a misnomer for many of the original structures that pass for habitable dwellings; rubble, cave, farmhouse in tragic ruin would be more apt descriptions. But for the twenty-two home owners profiled in Restoring a Home in Italy, courage, commitment, patience, and an ability to imagine the future allowed them to transform these pieces of the past into magical places to live today.</p><p> In evocative text and lush photographs, author Elizabeth Minchilli and photographer Simon McBride let us in on the beauty and charm of these homes throughout the country: hillside houses in Puglia, farmhouses in Tuscany and Umbria, attics in Venice, apartments in Rome, even former convents and caves. And though this is about Italy, where it is said there are no rules except what guides your heart, there are some obstacles along the way. Undertaking and expensive project in a foreign language, with a foreign bureaucracy and mountains of regulations - not to mention an alien sense of time - requires solid information an down-to-earth advice, all of which are here as well, as owners and designers explore the nuts and bolts of turning that crumbling set of walls into a warm, inviting home. A list of sources and terms will complete any would-be home owner's education.</p><p> So if you're seriously contemplating renovating your dream home in Italy, or are content just dreaming of it, Restoring a Home in Italy is the perfect guide.

Robert Holdstock was born in Kent, and lives in North London.Another of Holdstock's Mythago Wood series (The Hollowing, 1994, etc.) about a primeval woodland where space and time are distorted and where ``mythagos,'' figures from myth, legend, or dream, become real. Chronologically, this entry comes first in the series, and tells the story of George Huxley, his adult son, Christian, and their mutual obsession with the mythago Guiwenneth, the beautiful red-haired warrior princess from pre-Roman times. Chris's mother, Jennifer, crushed by the whole business, hangs herself from an oak tree after the Arthurian champion Kylhuk emerges from the woods to mark young Chris as his ``slathan,'' a mysterious term not explicated until much later. When Chris returns from WW II, he, like his father, enters the wood in pursuit of Guiwenneth and finds himself bound to Kylhuk's warriors, who must fight the evil sons of Kyrdu over the fate of another hero, Mabon, entombed alive inside a giant tree. Holdstock's figures, from the Welsh Mabinogion, Irish and British myth, are recognizably human despite their mythic origins and magical surroundings. Holdstock's remarkable creation, drawing skillfully upon such rich, resonant background material, exerts an endless fascination. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Even though I've literally read hundreds of books on the Beatles over the years, there were more than just a few new things I learned from Boys. Larry is a true insider of the Beatles, and that's why he's able to get the scoop from others WHO WERE ACTUALLY THERE AND ACTUALLY KNOW THE FACTS. That's the difference, and it's a big difference. Larry Kane is a great writer, and he tells the story about a group of Liverpool scruffs who eventually became people who reached first-name-only-needed status across the globe.

It is the true story of Gary Gilmore, who in 1977 became the first person executed in the United States since the reinstitution of the death penalty. Gilmore, a violent yet articulate man who chose not to fight his death-penalty sentence, touched off a national debate about capital punishment. He allowed Norman Mailer and researcher Lawrence Schiller complete access to his story. Mailer took the material and produced an immense book with a dry, unwavering voice and meticulous attention to detail on Gilmore's life--particularly his relationship with Nicole Baker, whom Gilmore claims to have killed. What unfolds is a powerful drama, a distorted love affair, and a chilling look into the mind of a murderer in his countdown with a firing squad.<b>Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize</b><br><br>In what is arguably his greatest book, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows<br>the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's<br>prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then<br>killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on<br>dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br><br>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. <b>The<br>Executioner's Song</b> is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br>American loneliness and violence.

The bulk of the text focuses on the military aspect of the Revolution, but the political and social sides receive ample coverage as well. Colorful sidebars on the mysterious origins of the U.S. flag, the evolution of Yankee Doodle, and a history of tarring and feathering are great entertainment for curious intellects. If you are going to include only a single book on the American Revolution in your library, this is probably the one to own.

Bolen frames the search for meaning at mid-life as a quest for the mysterious lost Grail of the Arthurian legend. For Bolen, the Grail represents the elusive object of a lifelong search for what is missing from our lives as well as from our culture. Bolen&#39;s pursuit takes her on an incredible journey to Europe that leads her to discover the importance of her own history, the changes and challenges at mid-life, and the meaning of the goddess in the lives of women. During a particularly difficult time in her life, Jean Bolen quite unexpectedly received a package in the mail from England. Inside was a beautiful gold pendant in the shape of an ancient archetypal image along with an invitation to make a pilgrimage to Chartres, Glastonbury, Iona and other sacred sites in Europe. It was sent by a total stranger, a woman who had come across one of the first copies of Goddesses in Everywoman, Bolen&#39;s ground-breaking work on women and archetypal myth. The synchronicity of the invitation was astonishing to Bolen, and she knew instinctively that she had been invited to embark on a quest that would change her life. So began the extraordinary pilgrimage that heralded Bolen&#39;s mid-life passage. Inspired by The Mists of Avalon, this tale of her European adventure is interwoven with penetrating psychological and spiritual insights as well as lore from Europe&#39;s sacred sites. While on her pilgrimage, Bolen reflects on the mystical experience that brought her into medicine, her awakening to the archetypal feminine through the experience of childbirth, the personal transformations that occurred after her divorce, the sources and significance of mid-life depression, and the importance of female friendship. This multilayered account journeys through and beyond the personal to reflect the mythological significance of the mid-life search for meaning and renewal.A MIDLIFE QUEST FOR THE GRAIL AND THE GODDESS <p>Dr. Jean Shinoda Bolen's extraordinary memoir celebrates the pilgrimmage that heralded her spiritual awakening and leads readers down the path of self-discovery. In this account of her journey to Europe in search of the sacred feminine, she unveils the mythological significance of the midlife search for meaning and renewal. </p><p>"[Bolen] charts a path that will lead many readers to the heart of their own emotional and spiritual pilgrimmages."--<i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i> </p><p>"This wise and challenging work, the most personal of Jean Shinoda Bolen's books, is an absorbing, often uncannily perceptive, and useful companion for the soul journeys of our time, which is The Time of the Goddess Returning."--Alice Walker, author of <i>The Color Purple</i> </p><p>"In <i>Crossing to Avalon</i>, Jean Shinoda Bolen turns her acute and brilliant eye toward the interconnectedness of women's mysteries, sacredness of the body, the effect of pilgrimage on soul, and deep feminine friendships."--Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Ph.D., author of <i>Women Who Run with the Wolves</i></p></p><h2>Murder in the Manuscript Room: A 42nd Street Library Mystery (The 42nd Street Library Mysteries, 2)</h2><p><p><b>The second in Con Lehane's 42nd Street Library mystery series, <i>Murder in the Manuscript Room</i> is a smart, compelling mystery in which the characters themselves are at least as interesting as the striking sleuthing.</b></p><p><b>"Not to be missed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Megan Abbott</i></b></p><p><b>"A story utterly relevant to the real-life horror story unfolding in America&#x2019;s immigration politics.&#x201d;&#x2015;Sara Paretsky</b><br><b></b><br>When a murder desecrates the somber, book-lined halls of New York City&#x2019;s iconic 42nd Street Library, Raymond Ambler, the library&#x2019;s curator of crime fiction, has a personal interest in solving the crime.

The Nobel Prize--winning writer's masterwork is the engrossing story of a Muslim family in Cairo during Britain's occupation of Egypt in the early decades of the twentieth century. <br>The novels of The Cairo Trilogy trace three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence. "Palace Walk introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons-the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad's rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in "Palace of Desire, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. "Sugar Street brings Mahfouz's vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician. <br>Throughout the trilogy, the family's trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries. Filled with compelling drama, earthy humor, and remarkable insight, The Cairo Trilogy is the achievement of a master storyteller.<p>Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911 and began writing when he was seventeen. His nearly forty novels and hundreds of short stories range from re-imaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture. Of his many works, most famous is The Cairo Trilogy, consisting of <i>Palace Walk</i> (1956), <i>Palace of Desire</i> (1957), and <i>Sugar Street</i> (1957), which focuses on a Cairo family through three generations, from 1917 until 1952. In 1988, he was the first writer in Arabic to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

They want to know <i>What&#x2019;s your story, morning glory? Tell me your tale, snail. </i>I hear their stories every day in Group, at lunch, in Crafts, at breakfast, at dinner, on and on. These words that spill from them, black memories, they can&#x2019;t stop. Their stories are eating them alive, turning them inside out. They cannot stop talking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut all my words out. My heart was too full of them.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I ROOM WITH LOUISA. LOUISA IS OLDER AND HER HAIR IS like a red-and-gold noisy ocean down her back. There&#x2019;s so much of it, she can&#x2019;t even keep it in with braids or buns or scrunchies. Her hair smells like strawberries; she smells better than any girl I&#x2019;ve ever known. I could breathe her in forever.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; My first night here, when she lifted her blouse to change for bed, in the moment before that crazy hair fell over her body like a protective cape, I saw them, all of them, and I sucked my breath in hard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be scared, little one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&#x2019;t scared. I&#x2019;d just never seen a girl with skin like mine.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> EVERY MOMENT IS SPOKEN FOR. WE ARE UP AT SIX o&#x2019;clock. We are drinking lukewarm coffee or watered-down juice by six forty-five. We have thirty minutes to scrape cream cheese on cardboardy bagels, or shove pale eggs in our mouths, or swallow lumpy oatmeal. At seven fifteen we can shower in our rooms. There are no doors on our showers and I don&#x2019;t know what the bathroom mirrors are, but they&#x2019;re not glass, and your face looks cloudy and lost when you brush your teeth or comb your hair. If you want to shave your legs, a nurse or an orderly has to be present, but no one wants that, and so our legs are like hairy-boy legs. By eight-thirty we&#x2019;re in Group and that&#x2019;s when the stories spill, and the tears spill, and some girls yell and some girls groan, but I just sit, sit, and that awful older girl, Blue, with the bad teeth, every day, she says, <i>Will you talk today, Silent Sue? I&#x2019;d like to hear from Silent Sue today, wouldn&#x2019;t you, Casper?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casper tells her to knock it off. Casper tells us to breathe, to make accordions by spreading our arms way, way out, and then pushing in, in, in, and then pulling out, out, out, and don&#x2019;t we feel better when we just breathe? Meds come after Group, then Quiet, then lunch, then Crafts, then Individual, which is when you sit with your doctor and cry some more, and then at five o&#x2019;clock there&#x2019;s dinner, which is more not-hot food, and more Blue: <i>Do you like macaroni and cheese, Silent Sue? When you getting those bandages off, Sue? </i>And then Entertainment.<br> After Entertainment, there is Phone Call, and more crying.<br> And then it&#x2019;s nine p.m. and more meds and then it&#x2019;s bed. The girls piss and hiss about the schedule, the food, Group, the meds, everything, but I don&#x2019;t care. There&#x2019;s food, and a bed, and it&#x2019;s warm, and I am inside, and I am safe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is not Sue. <br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> JEN S. IS A NICKER: SHORT, TWIGLIKE SCARS RUN UP AND down her arms and legs. She wears shiny athletic shorts; she&#x2019;s taller than anyone, except Doc Dooley. She dribbles an invisible basketball up and down the beige hallway. She shoots at an invisible hoop. Francie is a human pincushion. She pokes her skin with knitting needles, sticks, pins, whatever she can find. She has angry eyes and she spits on the floor. Sasha is a fat girl full of water: she cries in Group, she cries at meals, she cries in her room. She&#x2019;ll never be drained. She&#x2019;s a plain cutter: faint red lines crosshatch her arms. She doesn&#x2019;t go deep. Isis is a burner. Scabby, circular mounds dot her arms. There was something in Group about rope and boy cousins and a basement but I shut myself off for that; I turned up my inside music. Blue is a fancy bird with her pain; she has a little bit of everything: bad daddy, meth teeth, cigarette burns, razor slashes. Linda/Katie/Cuddles wears grandma housedresses. Her slippers are stinky. There are too many of her to keep track of; her scars are all on the inside, along with her people. I don&#x2019;t know why she&#x2019;s with us, but she is. She smears mashed potato on her face at dinner. Sometimes she vomits for no reason. Even when she is completely still, you know there is a <i>lot </i>happening inside her body, and that it&#x2019;s not good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew people like her on the outside; I stay away from her.</p><h2>Avengers: Time Runs Out (2) (Avengers, 2)</h2><p>The Avengers are fragmented!

The most celebrated scientific experiment of its time, it would lead to one of mankind's most devastating inventions--the atomic bomb.<br> <br>All matter is made mostly of empty space. Each of the billions of atoms that comprise it is hollow, its true mass concentrated in a tiny nucleus that, if the atom were a cathedral, would be no bigger than a fly. Discovering its existence three quarters of a century ago was Lord Rutherford's greatest scientific achievement, but even he caught only a glimpse. Almost at the point of despair, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, two young researchers in a grubby basement room at the famous Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, grappled with the challenge. Racing against their American and German counterparts-a colorful cast of Nobel Prize winners--they would change everything. With paper-and-pencil calculations, a handmade apparatus, the odd lump of plasticine, and some revolutionary physics, Cockroft and Walton raised the curtain on the atomic age.<br><i> </i><br><i>The Fly in the Cathedral </i>is a riveting and erudite narrative inspired by the dreams that lead the last true gentlemen scientists to the very essence of the universe: the heart of matter.<br></p><p>If you want to understand how something works, you can dismantle it and study its pieces. But what if the thing you're curious about is too small to see, even with the most powerful microscope? Brian Cathcart's <i>The Fly in the Cathedral</i> tells the intriguing story of how scientists were able to take atoms apart to reveal the secrets of their structures. To keep the story gripping, Cathcart focuses on a time (1932, the <i>annus mirabilis</i> of British physics), a place (Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory), and a few main characters (Ernest Rutherford, the "father of nuclear physics," and his prot�g�s, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton). <p> Rutherford and his team knew that the long-accepted atomic model was held together by nothing more than trumped-up math and hope. They hoped to find out what held oppositely charged protons and electrons together, and what strange particles shared the nucleus with protons. In a series of remarkable experiments done on homemade apparatus, these Cambridge scientists moved atomic science to within an inch of its ultimate goal. Finally, Cockcroft and Walton--competing furiously with their American and German peers--put together the machine that would forever change history by splitting an atom. <i>The Fly in the Cathedral</i> combines all the right elements for a great science history: historical context, gritty detail, wrenching failure, and of course, glorious victory. Although the miracles that occurred at Cambridge in 1932 were to result in the fearful, looming threat of atomic warfare, Cathcart allows readers to find unfiltered joy in the accomplishments of a few brilliant, ingenious scientists. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>A former reporter for Reuters and the Independent, <b>Brian Cathcart i</b>s the author of: <i>Test of Greatness: Britain's Struggle for the Atom Bomb, </i>among other books.

"Though we pride ourselves on our pragmatism," he observes in "The Fisherman's Chaucer," a lovely tribute to Juliana Berners, the medieval mother of all fishing scribes, "at times most of us harbor a very nearly occult obsession with some imagined higher awareness, a state of knowing that will give us the right lure, the right bait, the right rod, the right sequence of profanity--whatever it is that we're plainly not doing now that will be revealed to us, and we will become that most envied and lionized of fishermen--The Expert." <p> Throughout <i>Coachman</i>'s 14 individual reflections, Schullery continually roots around that occult obsession as he traces the evolution of fly-fishing from English streams to New England pools and the rushing waters of the American West. He is haunted by imaginings of the perfect dry fly, the genesis of a species of angler he calls trout bum, and the wisdom he can glean from tools of the trade left behind by fishermen past. Like all devoted anglers, he's a wonderfully inclusive storyteller. You don't have to know the origins of a Royal Coachman to be hooked; Schullery's wit and grace are enough to reel in the appreciative reader in everyone. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><p>Paul Schullery's <i>Royal Coachman</i> is a book about the lore, lure, and history of fly-fishing. "Fly-fishing is this great adventure we have in a thousand little episodes," he says, and in this book he writes about some of them with charm and wit. Reflecting on the history of the sport, from its reputed origins in Europe centuries past (and casting a suspicious eye on the so-called first fly-fishing author, who published five hundred years ago) to its more recent history in the United States (where, says Schullery, the founding fathers might have ventured out to Philadelphia's streamside banks for a little relaxation), Schullery recounts some of his own experiences as well as those of some of fly-fishing's legendary and quirky practitioners. "Knowing more about early American trout fishing only allows me to stretch that connection back further, to give me even more stories to remember, and more dreams to share," he writes.</p><p>Schullery celebrates some lesser-known fishermen and some seldom-appreciated waters, such as the limestone streams of Pennsylvania. He muses on the pursuit of the ever-more perfectly "natural" fly and contrasts that quest with the storied success of the royal coachman, perhaps the gaudiest fly ever invented. He writes about rods, about his fellow fishing writers, about fishing etiquette, and about the true definition of a "trout bum" (his requirements are surprisingly rigorous). He compares trout fishing in the East with trout fishing in the Rockies, both of which he has done for extended periods of time.</p><p>This is an irresistible book, written with grace, humor, and intelligence. <i>Trout</i> magazine called Schullery "our preeminent angling historian" while the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> referred to him as "a keen raconteur" and <i>Newsweek</i> dubbed him fly-fishing's "gentle ironist." <i>Royal Coachman</i> is his finest book yet.</p></p><h2>A Luminous Republic</h2><p><b>A new novel from a Spanish literary star about the arrival of feral children to a tropical city in Argentina, and the quest to stop them from pulling the place into chaos.</b><br><br>San Crist�bal was an unremarkable city&#x2014;small, newly prosperous, contained by rain forest and river.

Reprint." William W. Johnstone is one of the great American storytellers of our generation. Now the acclaimed author of the ASHES and MOUNTAIN MAN series brings us an unforgettable tale of war, love, courage and ultimate betrayal. . . It was a journey out of innocence into manhood, out of peace and into a war that wouldn&#x2019;t end. Terry Kovak was born with a special skill, the courage to use it, and patriotic pride in taking on a job no one else would do. Chosen for an elite, top secret squad of soldiers so deadly its own country couldn&#x2019;t acknowledge its existence, Kovak became the most feared soldier of his time. Until he was no longer needed. Until he was forced to fight a war of his own. From the green hills of Georgia to the killing jungles of Vietnam, from South America to a bloody revolution in Africa, Terry Kovak became a man without a country- a hero cut off from his family, his friends, and even his fellow soldiers. He was the last of the shadow government unit called the Dog Team- the one American who would never back down- at the risk of his honor, his ideals, and his life.</p><p></p><h2>Timekeeper (1)</h2><p><b><i>Two o'clock was missing.</i></b><br><br>In an alternate Victorian world controlled by clock towers, a damaged clock can fracture time--and a destroyed one can stop it completely.<br><br>It's a truth that seventeen-year-old clock mechanic Danny Hart knows all too well; his father has been trapped in a Stopped town east of London for three years.

Divided into three parts, the book covers materials used by jewellers, including metals, gemstones, enamels, and organic matter from pearls to early plastics; the development of styles in jewelry since the Middle Ages; and the hallmarking, distribution, and use of jewelry in recent centuries. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Clare Phillips, a leading authority on jewelry who has written widely on the subject, lives in England.England's Victoria and Albert Museum, specializing in the decorative arts, has one of the finest jewelry collections in the world. This oversize volume draws from that collection to celebrate jewelry from the last 500 years, from the Middle Ages to the modern and avant-garde styles. The book is divided into three sections. The first part describes the materials used in jewelry making; the second offers a chronological history of jewelry pieces; and the third covers manufacturing and distribution, including hallmarks. The text is very informative, but, of course, it is the photographs of the jewelry that most capture the reader's attention. Although the paper stock and binding are not of the quality of some coffee-table books on the topic, the photographs are well reproduced, and the range of jewelry shown makes the volume useful both for browsing and as a survey of the field. From medieval religious pieces, including a skeleton in an enameled casket to wire-art jewelry made from oxidized silver, there is something here for everyone to covet. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>The House by the Sea</h2><p>Sarton, May, House by the Sea, The</p><p>May Sarton (1912-1995) was an acclaimed poet, novelist, and memoirist.</p><h2>How Do Dinosaurs Eat Their Food?</h2><p>Would you like to have a protoceratops come over for dinner?

Set during the great San Francisco earthquake and fire, this page-turning tale of political corruption, vendettas, romance, rescue&#x2014;and murder&#x2014;is based on recently uncovered facts that forever change our understanding of what really happened. Told by a feisty young reporter, Annalisa Passarelli, the novel paints a vivid picture of the Victorian-era city, from the mansions of Nob Hill to the underbelly of the Barbary Coast to the arrival of tenor Enrico Caruso and the Metropolitan Opera. Central to the story is the ongoing battle&#x2014;fought even as the city burns&#x2014;that pits incompetent and unscrupulous politicians against a coalition of honest police officers, newspaper editors, citizens, and a lone federal prosecutor. With the appeal and texture of <i>The Alienist</i>, <i>Carter Beats the Devil</i>, and the novels of E. L. Doctrow, James Dalessandro weaves unforgettable characters and actual events into a compelling epic. Movie rights to the novel have been bought by Barry Levinson/SpringCreek Productions/Warner Brothers. The movie will enter pre-production soon.</p><p>James Dalessandro is a San Francisco-based screenwriter and author of several books, including mystery and true crime novels.Screenwriter and novelist Dalessandro (Bohemian Heart) pens an imaginative and dense interplay between fact and fiction in this story of corruption, crime lords and the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Annalisa Passarelli, the Evening Bulletin's music critic, narrates the tale with a mix of first-person intimacy and cool omniscience. She's secretly helping the chief of detectives, Byron Fallon, gather dirt on a corrupt political syndicate headed by Adam Rolf, city attorney and power broker. Rolf (a fictional character) owns the "puppet-mayor," Eugene Schmitz (an actual person), and is supported by an army of goons and waterfront toughs led by the infamous Shanghai Kelly, who, as Dalessandro notes in his afterword, was actually dead by 1906. Byron aims to arrest the mayor, the police chief and the city attorney in one fell swoop, but when he is killed investigating a murder at the waterfront, it's up to his son Hunter, a Stanford graduate and fledgling police detective, to carry his mantle. Annalisa and Hunter appeal to an association of honest cops known as the Brotherhood (co-led by Hunter's brother, Christian), who are dedicated to destroying Rolf's machine, although Hunter also has personal vengeance on his mind. They secure incriminating evidence, but before justice can be served, the earthquake strikes, plunging the city into chaos. This plot&#x2014;and all its subplots, one starring a beautiful Kansas runaway, another featuring tenor Enrico Caruso&#x2014;might have worked beautifully, but Dalessandro employs too many B-movie theatrics, and the love story falls flat. Still, there's plenty of suspense to keep readers turning pages to the bittersweet conclusion. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each country fought for survival, but this book focuses on the story of the Northern Patrol and the 10th Cruiser Squadron. <br><br><p>The Royal Navy's role during World War I denying Germany access to the sea, trade, and vital resources was crucial to helping Britain win the war on the Western Front. The 'Northern Blockade', located across the inhospitable waters between Iceland and Scotland, was to bring the German economy to its knees and destroy her home front morale. Likewise, the Royal Navy's success in negating Germany's attacks on British commerce prevented much suffering in Britain. <br><br></p><p>Steve Dunn vividly describes the final destruction of German surface vessel commerce warfare. He examines the American reaction to the British naval blockade and to Germany's war on trade as well as Germany's treatment of American sailors taken prisoner. Dunn also considers changes in strategy employed by both sides.<br><br></p><p><i>Blockade</i> brings to life the experiences of those who manned the blockade and creates a vivid picture of the dangers of duty in this highly significant, but overlooked aspect of World War I.</p></p><p>Steve Dunn has a special interest in the Royal Navy of the late Victorian, Edwardian, and First World War eras.

Formed of men from all parts of the country, Company K, 333rd Infantry, 84th Division saw more than one hundred days of combat, through the Battle of the Bulge to the Elbe River. Thirty-six men died, and nearly two hundred more were casualties by the time the war ended. Unusually well written, this account, as told in the words of the survivors, shows the side of war at which Keith Winston's V . . . Mail: letters of a World War II combat medic ( LJ 9/15/85) could only hint. The authors, former company officers, have drawn the battle and postwar experiences of these men and their families into one smooth, flowing narrative. Highly recommended for most collections. George F. Scheck, Naval War Coll. Lib., Newport, R.I.<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.Company K of the 84th Division reached Europe in early November 1944, five months after D-Day, and was quickly ordered to Germany, where the Allied armies were advancing against furious resistance. Two members of the company present a vivid picture of the fierceness of front-line fighting in WW II as they follow the unit from Geilenkirchen through the battle for Wurm, back to Geilenkirchen and through the Battle of the Bulge to occupation duty. The authors avoid sentimental cliches in their depiction of a group of triumphant citizen-soldiers. Readers who are not veterans of Company K, however, may find the final chapters, about the post-war lives of these ex-GIs, anticlimactic.

Even though we are more into fitness than ever, the programs we use are just not working well enough. Many are even dangerous and can weaken the body and make it prone to injury. Marv Marinovich, former conditioning coach for the Oakland Raiders and renowned sports trainer, and Dr. Edythe Heus, a chiropractor specializing in rehabilitating elite athletes, have developed ProBodX (Proper Body Exercise) to close this fitness gap. ProBodX is the only fitness and conditioning program that safely builds and tones muscle while increasing strength, flexibility, balance, and grace.</p><p>ProBodX was originally designed for professional athletes -- such as Jason Sehorn of the New York Giants and Steve Finley of the Arizona Diamondbacks -- looking to increase their level of athleticism and to avoid injury. In this book, the program has been designed for anyone who wants to improve athletic ability or simply get in shape and stay in shape without injury.</p><p>Essentially the ProBodX program combines unstable surfaces (gymnastic balls, slant boards, balance disks) with multiplane movement and strength loading (special hand and foot weights) to simultaneously stretch and strengthen the body. The result is a stimulated nervous system and increased speed, power, and flexibility.</p><p>Whether your interest is reducing body fat and increasing lean muscle, playing sports, or just maintaining a healthy body, ProBodX's unique balanced fitness program can help. In addition, the program includes a dynamic eating program based on Barry Sears's Zone Diet to truly jump start the body and see real results in four to six weeks.</p></p><p><p>Marv Marinovich is a nationally known sports enhancement specialist, a former Oakland Raiders offensive lineman, and NFL conditioning coach. He founded his own training center, SportsLab, where he trains elite athletes, children, and young adults. He lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, California.</p><br><br><p>Dr. Edythe M. Heus is an honors graduate of NY Chiropractic College. Presently she treats and trains professional and Olympic athletes, as well as teaching ProBodX classes. She is the director and founder of Blueprint, an exercise, treatment, and athletic performance research and enhancement center. She lives in southern California. </p>For decades, coaches have sent athletes eager to improve their strength and performance straight to the gym to pump some iron. According to authors Marinovich and Heus, such advice couldn't be more wrong. "America's obsession with heavy weight lifting was actually training greatness out of athletes," they explain in this comprehensive guide to their conditioning and Zone-based nutrition plan, ProBodX. Unlike weightlifting, which can slow down athletes by burdening them with excessive muscles, and unlike yoga, which can needlessly over-stretch ligaments, ProBodX is supposed to improve flexibility, strength, endurance and mental stamina without provoking injuries. The key, according to Marinovich and Heus, is to engage the "nervous and musculoskeletical systems as a whole rather than as separate parts." Thus, their ProBodX exercises rely upon wobbly, free-floating equipment-such as gymnastics balls and balance disks-that force the body to use more than a few muscles at a time. Heus and Marinovich have the experience to know what they're talking about: he was once an Oakland Raiders offensive lineman and an NFL conditioning coach; she was a New York chiropractor who specialized in kinesiology. And their current roster of clients includes successful athletes like Chicago Bulls player Tyson Chandler and Olympian high-jumper Amy Acuff, both of whom appear in photographs throughout the book. Their exercises are amply illustrated with step-by-step b&amp;w photographs. Despite the careful instructions, neophytes may still feel like they'd need a trainer to walk them through such exercises as the "Scissors," which involves twisting a knee to the ceiling while balancing a one's stomach on a giant gymnastics ball. But those who have the time and energy to learn a whole new way of exercising should find this volume well worth a try. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Vegas Heat</h2><p>Fern Michaels continues her magnificent new trilogy about the Coleman and the Thornton dynasties that she began in Vegas Rich.

Then things go bad, as one of the workers dies and the robbers hustle out to their truck to find themselves -- for just one second -- face to face with Weather Karkinnen, surgeon and wife of investigator Lucas Davenport. Did she see enough to identify them?</p></p><p>Pulitzer prize-winning journalist John Sandford is the author of the Prey series, four Kidd novels and the Virgil Flowers series. He lives in Minnesota. Visit www.johnsandford.org for more information.Three of them, hard men carrying nylon bags, wearing workjackets, Carhartts and Levi&#x2019;s, all of them with facial hair. Theywalked across the parking structure to the steel security door,heads swiveling, checking the corners and the overheads, steamflowing from their mouths, into the icy air, one of the men on acell phone. <p>As they got to the door, it popped open, and a fourth man,who&#x2019;d been on the other end of the cell-phone call, let themthrough. The fourth man was tall and thin, dark-complected,with a black brush mustache. He wore a knee-length black raincoatthat he&#x2019;d bought at a Goodwill store two days earlier, andblack pants. He scanned the parking structure, saw nothing moving,pulled the door shut, made sure of the lock. </p><p> &#x201c;This way,&#x201d; he snapped. </p><p>Inside, they moved fast, reducing their exposure, should someoneunexpectedly come along. No one should, at the ass-end ofthe hospital, at fifteen minutes after five o&#x2019;clock on a bitterly coldwinter morning. They threaded through a maze of service corridorsuntil the tall man said, &#x201c;Here.&#x201d; </p><p><i>Here </i> was a storage closet. He opened it with a key. Inside, a pileof blue, double-extra-large orderly uniforms sat on a medical cart. </p><p>The hard men dumped their coats on the floor and pulled theuniforms over their street clothes. Not a big disguise, but theyweren&#x2019;t meant to be seen close-up&#x2014;just enough to slip past avideo camera. One of them, the biggest one, hopped up on thecart, lay down and said, &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m dead,&#x201d; and laughed at his joke.The tall man could smell the bourbon on the joker&#x2019;s breath. </p><p> &#x201c;Shut the fuck up,&#x201d; said one of the others, but not in an unkindlyway. </p><p>The tall man said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be stupid,&#x201d; and there was nothingkind in his voice. When they were ready, they looked at eachother and the tall man pulled a white cotton blanket over the manon the cart, and one of the men said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Check yourself . . .&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t hurt anyone,&#x201d; the tall man said. The sentiment reflectednot compassion, but calculation: robbery got X amount ofattention, injuries got X-cubed. </p><p> &#x201c;Yeah, yeah . . .&#x201d; One of the men pulled a semiautomatic pistolfrom his belt, a heavy, blued, no-bullshit Beretta, stolen fromthe Army National Guard in Milwaukee, checked it, stuck it backin his belt. He said, &#x201c;Okay? Everybody got his mask? Okay.Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; </p><p>They stuffed the ski masks into their belts and two hard menpushed the cart into the corridor. The tall man led them fartherthrough the narrow, tiled hallways, then said, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the camera.&#x201d; </p><p>The two men pushing the cart turned sideways, as the tall mantold them to, and went through a cross-corridor. A security camerapeered down the hall at them. If a guard happened to belooking at the monitor at that moment, he would have seen onlythe backs of two orderlies, and a lump on the cart. The tall manin the raincoat scrambled along, on his hands and knees, on thefar side of the cart. </p><p>The big man on the cart, looking at the ceiling tiles go by,giggled, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like ridin&#x2019; the Tilt-A-Whirl.&#x201d; </p><p>When they were out of the camera&#x2019;s sight line, the tall manstood up and led them deeper into the hospital&#x2014;the three outsiderswould never have found the way by themselves. After twominutes, the tall man handed one of the outsiders a key, indicateda yellow steel door, with no identification. </p><p> &#x201c;This is it?&#x201d; The leader of the three was skeptical&#x2014;the doorlooked like nothing. </p><p> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the tall man. &#x201c;This is the side door. When you goin, you&#x2019;ll be right among them. One or two. The front door andservice window is closed until six. I&#x2019;ll be around the corner untilyou call, watching.&#x201d; </p><p>He&#x2019;d be around the corner where he could slip out of sight, ifsomething went wrong. </p><p>The other man nodded, asked, &#x201c;Everybody ready?&#x201d; The othertwo muttered, &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; tense now, pulled on the masks, took theirpistols out. The leader put the key in the lock and yanked openthe door. </p><p>Weather Karkinnen had taken a half-pill at nine o&#x2019;clock, knowingthat she wouldn&#x2019;t sleep without it. Too much to do, too muchto think about. The procedure had been researched, rehearsed,debated, and undoubtedly prayed over. Now the time had come. </p><p>Sleep came hard. She kept imagining that first moment, thefirst cut, the commitment, the parting of the flesh beneaththe edge of her scalpel, on a nearly circular path between theskulls of the two babies&#x2014;but sometime before nine-thirty, sheslip ped away. </p><p>She didn&#x2019;t feel her husband come to bed at one o&#x2019;clock in themorning. He took care not to disturb her, undressing in the dark,lying as unmoving as he could, listening to her breathing, untilhe, too, slipped away. </p><p>And then her eyes opened. </p><p>Pop. </p><p>Dark, not quite silent&#x2014;the furnace running in the winternight. She lifted her head to the clock. Four-thirty. She&#x2019;d beenasleep for seven hours. Eight would have been the theoreticalideal, but she never slept eight. She closed her eyes again, organizingherself, stepping through the upcoming day. At twenty minutesto five, she got out of bed, stretched, and headed to theen suite bathroom, checking herself: she felt sharp. Excellent. Shebrushed her teeth, showered, washed and dried her short-cutblond hair. </p><p>She&#x2019;d laid out her clothes the night before. She walked acrossthe bedroom barefoot, in the light of the two digital clocks, pickedthem up: a thick black-silk jersey and gray wool slacks, and dressy,black-leather square-toed shoes. She would have preferred towear soft-soled cross-training shoes, like the nurses did, but surgeonsdidn&#x2019;t dress like nurses. She&#x2019;d never even told anyone aboutthe gel innersoles. </p><p>She carried her clothes back to the bathroom, shut the door,turned on the light again, and dressed. When she was ready, shelooked at herself in the mirror. Not bad. </p><p>Weather might have wished to have been a little taller, for theauthority given by height; she might have wished for a chiselednose. But her husband pointed out that she&#x2019;d never had a problemgiving orders, or having them followed; and that he thought hernose, which she saw as lumpy, was devastatingly attractive, andthat any number of men had chased after her, nose and all. </p><p>So, not bad. </p><p>She grinned at herself, turned to make sure the slacks didn&#x2019;tmake her ass look fat&#x2014;they didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;switched off the light, openedthe bathroom door and tiptoed across the bedroom. Her husbandsaid, in the dark, &#x201c;Good luck, babe.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you were awake.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m probably more nervous than you are,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>She went back to the bed and kissed him on the forehead. &#x201c;Goback to sleep.&#x201d; </p><p>Downstairs in the kitchen, she had two pieces of toast, a cupof instant coffee, and a yogurt, got her bag, went out to the car,backed out of the garage, and headed downtown, on the snowystreets, across the river to the Minnesota Medical Research Center.She might be first in, she thought, but maybe not: there wereforty people on the surgical team. <i>Somebody </i> had to be more nervousthan she was. </p><p>At the hospital, the yellow door popped open and the threebig men swarmed through. </p><p>Two people were working in the pharmacy&#x2014;a short, slender,older man, who might once in the sixties have been a dancer, butno longer had the muscle tone. He wore a scuzzy beard on hischeeks, a soul patch under his lower lip. First thing, when he cameto work, he tied a paper surgeon&#x2019;s cap on his head, for the rushhe got when people looked at him in the cafeteria. The otherperson was a busy, intent, heavyset woman in a nurse&#x2019;s uniform,who did the end-of-shift inventory, making sure it was all there,the stacks and rows and lockers full of drugs. </p><p>Some of it, put on the street, was worthless. Nobody paysstreet prices to cure the heartbreak of psoriasis. </p><p>Most of it, put on the street&#x2014;on more than one street, actually;there was the old-age street, the uninsured street, the junkiestreet&#x2014;was worth a lot. Half-million dollars? A million? Maybe. </p><p>The three hard men burst through the door and were on topof the two pharmacy workers in a half-second. The woman hadenough time to whimper, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; before one of the men pushedher to the floor, gun in her face, so close she could smell the oilon it, and said, &#x201c;Shutta fuck up. Shut up.&#x201d; Soul-patch huddled intoa corner with his hands up, then sank to his butt. </p><p>The leader of the three waved a pistol at the two on the floorand said, &#x201c;Flat on the floor. Roll over, put your hands behind yourback. We don&#x2019;t want to hurt you.&#x201d; </p><p>The two did, and another of the men hurriedly taped theirhands behind them with gray duct tape, and then bound their feettogether. That done, he tore off short strips of tape and pastedthem over the victims&#x2019; eyes, and then their mouths. </p><p>He stood up: &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; </p><p>The leader pushed the door open again and signaled with afingertip. The tall man stepped in from the hallway, said, &#x201c;These,&#x201d;and pointed at a series of locked, glass-doored cupboards. And,&#x201c;Over here . . .&#x201d; </p><p>A row of metal-covered lockers. The leader of the big menwent to the man on the floor, who looked more ineffectual thanthe woman, and ripped the tape from his mouth. </p><p> &#x201c;Where are the keys?&#x201d; For one second, the man on the floorseemed inclined to prevaricate, so the big man dropped to hisknees and said, &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t tell me this minute, I will break yourfuckin&#x2019; skull as an example. Then you will be dead, and I will askthe fat chick.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;In the drawer under the telephone,&#x201d; Soul-patch said. </p><p> &#x201c;Good answer.&#x201d; </p><p>As the big man retaped Soul-patch&#x2019;s mouth, the tall man gotthe keys and began popping open the lockers. All kinds of goodstuff here, every opiate and man-made opiate except heroin;lots of hot-rock stimulants, worth a fortune with the big-namelabels. </p><p> &#x201c;Got enough Viagra to stock a whorehouse,&#x201d; one of the mengrunted. </p><p>Another one: &#x201c;Take this Tamiflu shit?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Fifty bucks a box in California . . . Take it.&#x201d; </p><p>Five minutes of fast work, the tall man pointing them at thegood stuff, sorting out the bad. </p><p>Then the old guy on the floor made a peculiar wiggle. </p><p>One of the holdup men happened to see it, frowned, thenwent over, half-rolled him. The old guy&#x2019;s hands were loose&#x2014;he&#x2019;dpulled one out of the tape, had had a cell phone in a belt clipunder his sweater, had worked it loose, and had been trying tomake a call. The big man grunted and looked at the face of thephone. One number had been pressed successfully: a nine. </p><p> &#x201c;Sonofabitch was trying to call nine-one-one,&#x201d; he said, holdingup the phone to the others. The old man tried to roll away, butthe man who&#x2019;d taken the phone punted him in the back once,twice, three times, kicking hard with steel-toed work boots. </p><p> &#x201c;Sonofabitch . . . sonofabitch.&#x201d; The boot hit with the sound ofa meat hammer striking a steak. </p><p> &#x201c;Let him be,&#x201d; the leader said after the third kick. </p><p>But the old man had rolled back toward his tormentor andgrasped him by the ankle, and the guy tried to shake him looseand the old man moaned something against the tape and held on,his fingernails raking the big guy&#x2019;s calf. </p><p> &#x201c;Let go of me, you old fuck.&#x201d; The guy shook him off his legand kicked him again, hard, in the chest. </p><p>The leader said, &#x201c;Quit screwing around. Tape him up againand let&#x2019;s get this stuff out of here.&#x201d; </p><p>The old man, his hands taped again, was still groaning as theyloaded the bags. That done, they went to the door, glanced downthe hallway. All clear. The bags went under the blanket on the cart,and the three big men pushed the cart past the security-cameraintersection, back through the rabbit warren to the utility closet,replaced the orderly uniforms with their winter coats, picked upthe bags. </p><p>The leader said, &#x201c;Gotta move, now. Gotta move. Don&#x2019;t knowhow much time we got.&#x201d; </p><p>Another of the men said, &#x201c;Shooter&#x2014;dropped your glove.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Ah, man, don&#x2019;t need that.&#x201d; He picked it up, and the tall manled them out, his heart thumping against his rib cage. Almost out.When they could see the security door, he stopped, and they wenton and out. The tall man watched until the door re-latched,turned, and headed back into the complex. </p><p>There were no cameras looking at the security door, or betweenthe door and their van. The hard men hustled through thecold, threw the nylon bags in the back, and one of them climbedin with them, behind tinted windows, while the leader took thewheel and the big man climbed in the passenger seat. </p><p> &#x201c;Goddamn, we did it,&#x201d; said the passenger. He felt under hisseat, found a paper bag with a bottle of bourbon in it. He wasunscrewing the top as they rolled down the ramp; an Audi A5convertible, moving too fast, swept across the front of the vanand caught the passenger, mouth open, who squinted against thelight. For just a moment, he was face-to-face with a blond woman,who then swung past them into the garage. </p><p> &#x201c;Goddamnit!&#x201d; </p><p>The leader braked and looked back, but the A5 had alreadyturned up the next level on the ramp. He thought they might turnaround and find the woman . . . but then what? Kill her? </p><p> &#x201c;She see you guys?&#x201d; asked the man in the back, who&#x2019;d seenonly the flash of the woman&#x2019;s face. </p><p>The guy with the bottle said, &#x201c;She was looking right at me.Goddamnit.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Nothing to do,&#x201d; the leader said. &#x201c;Nothing to do. Get out ofsight. Shit, it was only one second . . .&#x201d; </p><p>And they went on. </p><p>Weather had seen the man with the bottle, but paid no attention.Too much going through her head. She went on to the physicians&#x2019;parking, got a spot close to the door, parked, and hurriedinside. </p><p>The tall man got back to the utility closet, pulled off the raincoatand pants, which he&#x2019;d used to conceal his physician&#x2019;s scrubs: ifthey&#x2019;d been seen in the hallway, the three big men with a doc,somebody would have remembered. He gathered up the scrubsabandoned by the big men, stuffed them in a gym bag, along withthe raincoat and pants, took a moment to catch his breath, toneaten up. </p><p>Listened, heard nothing. Turned off the closet light, peekedinto the empty hallway, then strode off, a circuitous route, avoidingcameras, to an elevator. Pushed the button, waited impatiently. </p><p>When the door opened, he found a short, attractive blondwoman inside, who nodded at him. He nodded back, poked &#x201c;1,&#x201d;and they started down, standing a polite distance apart, with justthe trifle of awkwardness of a single man and a single woman,unacquainted, in an elevator. </p><p>The woman said, after a few seconds, &#x201c;Still hard to come towork in the dark.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t wait for summer,&#x201d; the tall man said. They got to &#x201c;2,&#x201d;and she stepped off and said, &#x201c;Summer always comes,&#x201d; and shewas gone. </p><p>Weather thought, as she walked away from the elevator, <i>Nopoint looking at the kids</i>. They&#x2019;d be asleep in the temporary ICUthey&#x2019;d set up down the hall from the operating room. She wentinstead to the locker room and traded her street clothes for surgicalscrubs. Another woman came in, and Weather nodded toher and the other woman asked, &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t sleep?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Got a few hours,&#x201d; Weather said. &#x201c;Are we the only two here?&#x201d; </p><p>The woman, a radiologist named Regan, laughed: &#x201c;No. John&#x2019;sgot the doll on the table and he&#x2019;s talking about making somechanges to the <i>table</i>, for God&#x2019;s sakes.

Emma is also the author of <em>Raising Bookworms</em>. </p>K-Gr 4-In this latest installment in the series, cats Bo and Panache find themselves in the sights of pirates. They are aboard the tony Legend with Billy Bates, Captain Ian Fraser, Lord and Lady Goodlad, and the rest of the crew on what is supposed to be a pleasure cruise through the Mediterranean. The baddies that showed up in earlier books are back, and this time they want to take over the yacht and take down part of Lord Goodlad's business. Bo and Panache play a large part in foiling the intruders in an action-packed scene. After the day is saved, the trip is canceled and Billy and the crew are instructed to take the vessel back to London. When they arrive, the felines are treated like celebrities and invited to have an audience with the Queen. The culmination of the story has Bo reunited with family members once more. This is a series that must be read in order and in its entirety for the stories to be fully understood. There are flashbacks in the text, but they are brief and fast paced. The vocabulary is quite sophisticated ("phosphorescence," "flotilla," etc.), and French phrases are peppered throughout, making the book best for reading aloud.-Stacy Dillon, LREI, New York City&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

In 1983, Harold and Sandra were visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when they came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image provided the inspiration for ""Good Dog, Carl,"" which successfully began what would become an increasingly popular picture book series. The Darling's own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the first book's main character. Since then, three other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels. The Darlings now live in Seattle, Washington, where they have a ten-thousand-book library, primarily filled with illustrated children's books. <br>&#34;&#34;This book very eloquently speaks to anyone who has been moved by the loss of an animal friend.... This wonderful book...evokes a sense of peaceful reflection that is therapeutic for the soul.&#34;&#34;</p><h2>Those Wonderful Women in Their Flying Machines: The Unknown Heroines of World War Two</h2><p>A narrative history, from first-hand interviews, of the valiant American women pilots of World War II.</p><p>Writer, pilot and niece of a World War II female B-17 pilot."Sally Van Wagenen Keil has restored the WASPs to history with full honors in this affectionate and savvy book." -- <i>The New York Times Book Review </i><br><br>... takes a bit of neglected American history and goes through it like a P-51 through a bevy of barrage balloons. -- <i>Sarasota Herald-Tribune </i><br><br>An important, exciting book. -- <i>Library Journal </i><br><br>If you think the skies belong to birds and men, you might want to consider a different notion. <i>Ladybirds</i> and <i>Ladybirds II</i> is a history of American women in every aspect of aviation from a woman balloonist of 200 years ago, to the early days of Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart, to today's commercial women airline pilots (co-author Lori Griffith is a Boeing 737 captain with USAir). <i>Those Wonderful Women and Their Flying Machines</i> hones in on World War II to recount the story of the over 1,000 women pilots who flew in the military as part of the Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASP). Over 25,000 women applied and 1,800 were selected to train at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. From 1942 to '44, these pilots flew over 60 million miles in every type of plane the airforce had, and 38 women lost their lives in service. Here, in biography style, the niece of one of these pilots recreates the amazing story of what she calls "one of the best-kept secrets of World War II." Together, these books record an unexplored part of American and aviation history along with the passion of women who loved to fly. -- <i>From The WomanSource Catalog &amp; Review: Tools for Connecting the Community for Women</i></p><h2>The wheels of commerce, vol.2: civilisation and capitalism 15th-18th</h2><p>The Wheels of Commerce.

Tozer. How can we ignore the will of God and still expect His guidance in our lives? The truth is that we cannot. Tozer warns the unbeliever who claims a faith in the Lord to examine his life and to seek out the hypocrisy in his ways. This book offers up a stark reminder that Christianity today is made up of too many words and not enough action.</p><p>Tozer puts forth a theological pathway for the track of the ambitious evangelical Christian. He clarifies many of the doctrinal shortcomings that have clouded our churches and Sunday school classrooms over the years. Christ s sacrifice was once and for all, and as A. W. Tozer argues, it is our sin that keeps us from a fruitful relationship with God. The Christian life is a journey, a growth that is to be attained over the course of a lifetime. Too often churchgoers grow older without growing holier. Tozer sums up his revivalist mentality: Let a man approach the burning bush of divine truth with the desire to grasp it in his hand and the intensity of the fire will blind his eyes and cauterize his hands and face to the point of insensibility. Before the awesome vision of revealed truth, the human intellect should kneel and hide its face in trembling adoration.</p></p><p><b>A. W. Tozer</b> (1897&#x2013;1963) began his lifelong pursuit of God after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio, at the age of seventeen. The self-taught theologian committed his life&nbsp;to the ministry of God&#x2019;s Word as a pastor, teacher, and writer. For his flowing prose, Spirit-filled words, and deep conviction, many have called him a modern-day prophet. He is the author of the beloved classic <i>The Pursuit of God </i>and dozens of other works.</p><h2>James Joyce</h2><p>This acclaimed biography has won both the James Tait Black and the Duff Cooper Memorial Prizes.</p><p>Although several biographers have thrown themselves into the breach since this magisterial book first appeared in 1959, none have come close to matching the late Richard Ellmann's achievement. To be fair, Ellmann does have some distinct advantages. For starters, there's his deep mastery of the Irish milieu--demonstrated not only in this volume but in his books on Yeats and Wilde. He's also an admirable stylist himself--graceful, witty, and happily unintimidated by his brilliant subjects. But in addition, Ellmann seems to have an uncanny grasp on Joyce's personality: his reverence for the Irishman's literary accomplishment is always balanced by a kind of bemused affection for his faults. Whether Joyce is putting the finishing touches on <i>Ulysses</i>, falling down drunk in the streets of Trieste, or talking dirty to his future wife via the postal service, Ellmann's account always shows us a genius <i>and</i> a human being--a daunting enough task for a fiction writer, let alone the poor, fact-fettered biographer.The fresh material deals with most aspects of Joyce&#39;s life: his writings and his attitude towards them, his experiences of love and desire, his domestic travails, his political views.</p><h2>The Substitute Teacher from the Black Lagoon</h2><p>Mrs. Green is sick today.

Where will we find the <i>dirt</i>? Where&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The end of Phillip Bell&#x2019;s question disappeared as he paced the stage in the small auditorium at the Holston Homeplace Living History Farm, hands behind his back. The two dozen high school students in the audience tracked his movements like metronomes. I watched from the door, where I could see their faces.</p><p>Phillip, who couldn&#x2019;t have been ten years older than the youngest student, screwed his face into a puzzle of concentration as he continued pacing. He brought one hand from behind his back to stroke the neat line of beard along his chin. If he hadn&#x2019;t been dressed in a mid-nineteenth-century farmer&#x2019;s heavy brogues, brown cotton trousers, linen shirt, and wide-brimmed felt hat, he would have looked like a freshly minted junior professor. The students&#x2019; reactions to him were as entertaining as Phillip himself.</p><p>Without warning, Phillip jerked to a stop, swiveled to face the students, and flung his arms wide. <i>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;</i> he asked. &#x201c;Where are the <i>bodies</i> buried?&#x201d;</p><p>Startled, the teens in the front row jumped back in their seats. The boy nearest me recovered first. He slouched down again, stretching his long legs out so his feet rested against the edge of the stage. He smirked at his neighbor, then turned the smirk to Phillip.</p><p>&#x201c;In the cemet&#x2014;&#x201d; the boy started to say.</p><p>Phillip flicked the answer away. &#x201c;No, no, no. Not the cemetery. Boring places. Completely predictable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unlike Phillip Bell,&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s voice said behind my left ear. &#x201c;Full of himself, isn&#x2019;t he? What a showman.&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder to smile at Nadine Solberg. She&#x2019;d crossed the carpeted hall from her office without my noticing. She didn&#x2019;t return my smile. She was watching Phillip as raptly as the students and gave no indication that she expected an answer to her comment. I turned back to watch, too.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Phillip said to the students, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s someplace better than cemeteries. That&#x2019;s besides the fact that no living Holston&#x2014;or anyone else&#x2014;is going to let us dig up his sainted Uncle Bob Holston or Aunt Millie Holston from the family plot. And you can bet <i>that</i> is chiseled in stone. Not chiseled on a gravestone, though.&#x201d; The students laughed until they realized Phillip wasn&#x2019;t laughing with them. When their laughter died, he turned and stared at the boy who&#x2019;d brought up cemeteries. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t a Holston, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>The boy started to open his mouth, then opted for a head shake. Under Phillip&#x2019;s continued stare, the long legs retracted and the boy dropped his gaze to the open notebook in his lap.</p><p>Phillip looked around the room. &#x201c;Are any of you Holstons? Last name? Unfortunate first name? Anyone with a suspicious <i>H</i> for a middle initial?&#x201d;</p><p>Students shook their heads, looked at one another.</p><p>&#x201c;Just as well,&#x201d; Phillip said. &#x201c;The Holston clan might not like what I&#x2019;m about to tell you. Have you got your pencils ready? Take this down. Two words. Two beautiful words describing some of the most interesting places on earth. Some of my favorite places. Much less predictable than cemeteries.&#x201d; He turned a pitying look on the formerly smirking boy. &#x201c;And that makes them so much <i>better</i> than cemeteries. Where are we going to find the <i>real</i> stories? Two words. &#x2018;Garbage dump.&#x2019; Yes sir, I love a good old garbage dump. &#x2018;Old&#x2019; being the operative word.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will your ladies and a crazy quilt be able to compete with Phillip and his garbage dump?&#x201d; Nadine asked in my ear.</p><p>&#x201c;I think we can hold our own, although &#x2018;crazy&#x2019; might be the operative word in our case. Is Phillip always &#x2018;on&#x2019; like this?&#x201d; We watched as he described the contents of a nineteenth-century household dump in loving detail.</p><p>&#x201c;You should have seen him when he interviewed for the assistant director position,&#x201d; Nadine said. &#x201c;He wore a purple frock coat. He looked like the Gene Wilder version of Willy Wonka, and he gave the search committee a tour of the Homeplace like they&#x2019;d never heard before. As I said, quite the showman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And it worked. You hired him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I did.&#x201d;</p><p>There was something in her voice that made me turn my back on Phillip Bell&#x2019;s theatrics and look at her more closely. What I saw was the usual impeccable Nadine Solberg, director of the state-owned historic farm&#x2014;a site people in Blue Plum liked to describe as Colonial Williamsburg on a personal scale, ignoring the fact that it was a nineteenth-century farm instead of an eighteenth-century town. <i>Slim, silver, successful, and sixty</i>, is how my friend Ardis Buchanan described Nadine. <i>Sparkling</i> would usually suit Nadine, too, but the sparkle was missing today.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s he working out?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Are you happy with him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>I</i> am,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s only been here six weeks, though, and the Holston jury is still out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;</p><p>Nadine&#x2019;s unease was easy to understand. She was new at the site, too, though not as new as Phillip. She&#x2019;d been the state&#x2019;s solution&#x2014;plucked from a position with the Historical Commission in Nashville and dropped into this job in tiny Blue Plum&#x2014;when the former director had resigned without notice four months earlier. Not only had Nadine taken over without benefit of a transition period, but she&#x2019;d inherited a search already in progress for the site&#x2019;s first full-time professionally qualified assistant director. It was a search fueled by private money raised by well-heeled Holstons from Houston, Texas, who knew how to make things happen.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been miracle workers,&#x201d; Nadine said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re kind and generous people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But that generosity comes with hidden costs?&#x201d; I asked, thinking of the strings a powerful family might attach to the money they donated.</p><p>&#x201c;You will never hear those words from my lips,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ms. Solberg?&#x201d; Phillip called. &#x201c;Ms. Rutledge? Coming on the tour?&#x201d; </p><p>Nadine stepped past me into the room. &#x201c;Unfortunately for me, there&#x2019;s a meeting I can&#x2019;t miss. But I&#x2019;ll see you all back here in an hour or so. We&#x2019;ll have snacks and cold drinks in the education room, and then we&#x2019;ll get down to the nitty-gritty of Hands on History.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Unless by then you&#x2019;ve buried yourselves in Mr. Bell&#x2019;s garbage dump and can&#x2019;t pull yourselves out.&#x201d;</p><p>The students laughed. Phillip didn&#x2019;t ask again if I planned to join the tour and didn&#x2019;t wait to see if I tagged along. Without looking back, he led the students out the door on the opposite side of the room. I turned to Nadine, but she&#x2019;d already disappeared across the hall into her office and shut that door. I turned back to the auditorium in time to see the door closing there, too. </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, thank you,&#x201d; I said, feeling grumpy, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to take your tour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I was going to ask you,&#x201d; a voice said from the stage. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll be happy to show you around if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked and saw a young woman standing in the middle of the stage, hands in the back pockets of her jeans, short dark hair pushed behind her ears.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you one of the students with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I pointed to the door Phillip and the students had gone through. But the room had been empty. I&#x2019;d watched them leave.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a volunteer,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Kath Rutledge, aren&#x2019;t you? I recognize you from your shop. I&#x2019;ve been in a few times. I love the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat.&#x201d; She looked down at the front of her T-shirt. &#x201c;And I forgot my name badge again. I&#x2019;m Grace Estes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you just come from?&#x201d; I asked, ignoring her pleasant greeting and proving to myself, once again, how graceless my manners could be when something puzzled me.</p><p>Grace didn&#x2019;t seem to mind. She looked over her shoulder at the wall behind the stage, hands still in her back pockets. I followed her gaze. Of course. There was a discreet door in the wall for back-of-stage entrances and exits.</p><p>&#x201c;The education room&#x2019;s through there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I was setting out the refreshments.&#x201d;</p><p>She hopped off the stage, and I made my way along a row of seats to meet her at the side door.</p><p>&#x201c;Someday,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;if Nadine gets money for renovations, it would be great to bump this wall out, add seats, and improve the traffic flow in here.&#x201d; She grinned. &#x201c;Do I sound like I&#x2019;m doing a building usability study?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Practicing, anyway. I took a class in building and design for historic sites last semester and I&#x2019;m still psyched. Were you serious about taking a tour?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Believe it or not, I&#x2019;ve never taken the official tour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, then. We&#x2019;ll catch up with Phil.&#x201d;</p><p>She opened the door and we started through at the same time, shoulders and hips colliding. I reached out to steady her. Grace laughed, then caught at my elbow when she heard my sharp intake of breath.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; I put a few steps between us. And tried to ignore the feeling of her shirtsleeve on my fingertips. Only a spark of emotion had passed through me&#x2014;Longing? Loss? A stab of love and pain&#x2014;it had been enough to startle me, not enough to make me stagger. Not enough to look her in the eye and know more about her than I should. I still didn&#x2019;t understand these occasional odd flashes. How was it possible that I could brush up against someone else&#x2019;s emotional state merely by brushing against a fabric they wore? I didn&#x2019;t like it, and I didn&#x2019;t know why it had been happening since Granny died and I&#x2019;d moved here to run the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat&#x2014;her shop that was now mine. It was crazy. <i>No</i>, not crazy; I was no crazier than Granny had been. And even if I didn&#x2019;t like the flashes, maybe I was getting used to them.</p><p>Grace still looked concerned.</p><p>&#x201c;Really, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; I held out my hand and made myself smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to meet you, too, by the way.&#x201d;</p><p>Up close it was easy to see she was closer in age to Phillip than one of the high school students I&#x2019;d mistaken her for. Her warm smile and the hands slipping into her back pockets again made her look confident and comfortable. I liked her. I liked the humor in her eyes.</p><p>We followed a brick path across an expanse of lawn toward the site&#x2019;s dozen or so historic buildings. The two-story antebellum clapboard house&#x2014;the centerpiece of the Homeplace&#x2014;sat on a rise to our left. I spotted Phillip and the students straight ahead of us, leaving the log corncrib and heading for the barn.</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re studying site management?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On again, off again,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Small problem with cash flow, but I&#x2019;ll get there eventually.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stick with it. Of course, the cash-flow problems will stick with you, too, if you stay with the public-servant side of sites and preservation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got firsthand experience with that. I worked part-time for a couple of years at a site in West Virginia. So, yeah, I&#x2019;ve been there, but it&#x2019;s what I love, so I plan to keep doing it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. That&#x2019;s what it takes. Were you really looking for me earlier? You said you were going to ask me something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When I put the program handbooks together, I saw that you&#x2019;re talking about signature quilts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Signature quilts and crazy quilts. We&#x2019;ll work with the students to piece a quilt combining both forms, although I don&#x2019;t know how far we&#x2019;ll get in two weeks.&#x201d; When Nadine had described her plans for Hands on History, an enrichment program for high school students, I&#x2019;d told her it sounded ambitious but exciting. Then, when she&#x2019;d asked me to be one of the volunteer instructors, and told me I could introduce the kids to nineteenth-century textiles&#x2014;my professional area of expertise&#x2014;I could hardly say no.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to sit in on the quilt discussion, if you don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;Or if you have room for extra hands, I&#x2019;ll be happy to help with the quilting. I&#x2019;ve done a few small pieces of my own. Nothing fancy, but if nothing else, I can thread a needle.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s not always a given. Sure, if you have the time, TGIF will be happy to have you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Teaching who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry. T-G-I-F&#x2014;Thank Goodness It&#x2019;s Fiber. It&#x2019;s the needlework group that meets at the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat. Some of the members are quilters, and they&#x2019;re going to do most of the work with the students on the quilt. I&#x2019;m just giving the kids historical background.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, right. <i>Just</i>,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;Nadine told me about your background in textiles and museums. It&#x2019;s very cool. Did you consider applying for the assistant director job here? I know you still get your hands on fibers and textiles at the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat, but they aren&#x2019;t historic. They don&#x2019;t have the <i>stories</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The timing wasn&#x2019;t really right.&#x201d; </p><p>Grace shook her head, maybe thinking I lacked drive or ambition. I could have told her about the personal and professional pain of losing my dream job at the Illinois State Museum because of massive state budget cuts. But there wasn&#x2019;t time to tell that sad story&#x2014;what I&#x2019;d come to think of as my professional yarn&#x2014;before we caught up to the tour.

A nightmare in the rear-view mirror. A unique winner in the boardroom. A seven-time Winston Cup champion. A driver whose personal success story and dedication inspired the adoration of millions of fans. Then on February 18, 2001, just seconds from the Daytona 500 finish line, the world of stock-car racing suffered a devastating loss as Dale Earnhardt fatally careened into a track wall. The tragic shock waves, and an unprecedented outpouring of respect and love, have not stopped since.<br></b><br><i>At the Altar of Speed </i>takes readers behind the scenes of Earnhardt's celebrated life, tracing his rags-to-riches journey to the top of America's fastest-growing sport. Beginning with Earnhardt's early days growing up in small-town North Carolina, veteran sports writer Leigh Montville examines how a ninth-grade dropout started on the dusty dirt tracks of the South, went through two marriages and a string of no-future jobs before turning twenty-five, then took about a million left turns to glory. Through the pitfalls and triumphs, Earnhardt would ultimately become a celebrated champion, whose lifetime earnings would top forty-one million dollars. The son of a legendary racer, the father of a NASCAR star, he lived a total auto-racing life filled with triumph and sadness, great joy and great pain.<br><br>Transporting readers to the colorful, noisy world of stock-car racing, where powerful engines allow drivers to reach speeds of 200 m.p.h., <i>At the Altar of Speed </i>vividly captures the man who drove the black No. 3 car, a man whose determination and inner strength left behind a legacy of greatness that has redefined his sport. Illustrated with a section of full-color photographs, <i>At the Altar of Speed </i>is a tribute to both the man and his unbeatable spirit.</p><p>A senior writer for <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, LEIGH MONTVILLE also served for twenty-one years as a sports columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>.

To honor Dale...<br>A thirty-five-year-old tow truck operator in Kenosha, Wisconsin. finished work, picked up his son and his father and started driving. Twenty hours later, they were in Mooresville in front of the offices of Dale Earnhardt Incorporated. Just wanted to be there. He said he had left money with friends back in Kenosha to rent a billboard to say goodbye to Dale...<br><br>A traveler from Los Angeles reported on the internet that he was near Daytona Beach, taking pictures of a Titan rocket launch from the Space Center a week after the accident. The contrails from the rocket, moved by the wind, formed a giant No. 3 in the sky. He posted a picture...<br><br>The proprietor of Tropical Tattoos in Daytona Beach, Fl. said he did a number of Dale Earnhardt tattoos on a number of bodies. He said he did two on the Monday after the accident...<br><br>Crowds gathered. People cried. <br><br>Everywhere you looked, if you looked hard enough, there seemed to be a tribute. Something....<br></i><br>THE CRASH <br><br>The intelligent head argued with the intelligent eyes. That was the thing. The eyes saw the severity of the crash. The eyes had seen other crashes in other places, the same speed, the same angle, the same unmerciful thud against a concrete wall. The eyes knew something terrible had happened. The intelligent head knew Dale Earnhardt was involved. He would be all right. <br><br>Eyes vs. head. What was a television color commentator supposed to say?<br><br>"How about Dale?" Darrell Waltrip asked into his Fox Sports microphone late on that Sunday afternoon of February 18, 2001. "I hope he's OK." <br><br>"Of course he's OK," the head screamed in response. "That's Dale. He walks away. Dale Earnhardt. He always walks away." <br><br>"I just hope Dale's OK," Waltrip said again into his microphone. "I guess he's all right, isn't he?" <br><br>The emotions that crowded inside the broadcast booth at the Daytona International Speedway were too much, too much, way too much to handle. Jesus, Good Lord, they were. Look out the window at one spot on the track and there was the surprise winner of the Daytona 500, Michael Waltrip, Darrell Waltrip's thirty-seven-year-old baby brother, off on a victory lap in his yellow NAPA No. 15 car, happier than happy after capturing the biggest stock car race in all Creation, first win in his life in his 463rd race...look at another spot on the track and there was Dale. <br><br>Was he all right? <br><br>The monitors in the control truck blinked out all the color-camera choices. Happy winner. Happy. Live. Crash on tape. The black No. 3 car is going all right, going all right, wait a minute, nudged, going left, going right - slow it down - that's the No. 36 car, the yellow car, Kenny Schrader, coming in from the side, the M&amp;M's car, hits the No. 3 car and they go into the wall together and, wow, everything flies everywhere. Crash live. The car is back on the grass, rolled down the embankment from the wall. What are they doing? Why isn't Dale crawling out of there? The rescue workers have arrived. Maybe he broke a leg. Maybe the side was caved in. Boy, is he going to be pissed at somebody. Won't he? Where is Dale? <br><br>Way too much. <br><br>The voices from the truck came through Darrell Waltrip's ear piece and joined the voice in his head. Dale will be fine. Dale has been in about a billion of these crashes, much worse than this one. If he comes out of that car soon enough, we may even get a word with him. Won't that be a hoot? The eyes of Waltrip, a fifty-four-year-old man who had driven for thirty years, won 84 races and three Winston Cup championships, knew better. They had seen just about all of the good things and all of the bad that can happen on a race track. This was bad. <br><br>"This is bad," he told the voices in the truck. <br><br>The other color man in the booth, Larry McReynolds, was pretty much speechless. He didn't know what to say. This was his debut as a color commentator after a lifetime of work as a race car mechanic. For two years in his career, he had been Dale Earnhardt's crew chief. He trained his binoculars on the activity around the mangled No. 3 car down the track, the car he once had treated with the same love and care he gave his children, and found himself paralyzed by the inner debate. <br><br>"Schrader is looking in the car...backing off in a hurry...that's not good...oh, could be anything...maybe Dale's unconscious...<br><br>"The emergency crew is reaching inside, working on him...that could be something bad. No, that could be anything...<br><br>"The emergency crew is cutting off the roof...that's not good...then, again, it's standard procedure. If Dale broke something...<br><br>"They're putting him on a stretcher, taking him to the ambulance...OK, that's standard procedure...<br><br>"They're covering up the car...<br><br>"The ambulance is not going very fast...<br><br>Shit. <br><br>The idea that the greatest driver in NASCAR history could crash and die on the final turn of the final lap of the biggest race on the NASCAR schedule simply did not compute. Especially if that driver was Dale Earnhardt.</p><h2>How It All Vegan!: Irresistible Recipes for an Animal-Free Diet</h2><p><p>Vegan food is fabulous food, full of flavor and all the nutrients you need.

The narrative concerns Lucas Ellington, whose daughter was trampled to death at a rock concert. Ellington has committed himself to exterminating the members of Whip Hand, the rock group whose performance incited the audience to stampede. At first a sympathetic character, Ellington becomes gradually less soand less believable as we come to see him as an insane but cunning wild animal. The other characters are mostly cyphers, except for Gabriel Stannard, Whip Hand's lead singer, an insecure pretty boy who masquerades as an urban guerrilla, complete with large arsenal and killer friends. Both the pace and style are uneven, and the plot is fairly predictable, but there are one or two surprises that, gratifyingly, work well. Schow demonstrates that he has the raw material to produce a really good thriller, although this one isn't it. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Readers of this first novel will understand why Schow wins awards for his horror stories. Lucas Ellington seeks to avenge his daughter's death at a rock concert by destroying band members one by one. The last one left alive is forced to live up to a macho image by stalking his stalker in return. Lucas is a sympathetic character at first, but increasingly his craziness is revealed. This novel deals with the dark side of rock music and media exploitation but, in a larger sense, it explores what revenge does to the avenger. Graphic sex, violence, and vulgarity may turn some readers off, but this is otherwise strongly recommended for horror collections. Marylaine Block, St. Ambrose Univ.

And when his blood ties force him to choose a side in an unwinnable conflict, Owen begins to wonder if he will ever see peace in Texas again.</p></p><p><p><b>Elmer Kelton</b> (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Other Men's Horses</i>, and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>. He grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, <i>Hot Iron</i>, was published in 1956. Among his awards have been seven Spurs from Western Writers of America and four Western Heritage awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. His novel <i>The Good Old Boys</i> was made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones. In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for 42 years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He died in 2009.</p>Chapter 1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The war against the Union lay five weeks behind him, and he had crossed the Sabine out of Louisiana four days ago. Owen Danforth was beginning to feel at last that he was truly back in Texas. Here, until he decided he was ready to return, the war would not touch him. <br> <i>Until he was ready</i>&#x2026;A dull throbbing brought his right hand up to grip his tightly bandaged left arm. Not all the fever had left it. He wondered if he would <i>ever</i> be ready to go back. <br>Late in the morning he had broken out of the close and confining piney woods. Now he rode upon the higher, drier prairies that looked and smelled of home. His rump itched with an urgency for getting there, but the afternoon sun was in his eyes, and he knew night would catch him with miles yet to go. The big Yankee horse beneath him no longer took a long and easy stride. The journey had been wearying, and only a couple of times along the way had Owen managed to beg oats or corn for him from some farmer he met, some stranger in whose barn he slept a night. The war had left little enough even for people to eat, and horses must sustain on whatever grazing they could find. The fresh spring grass was yet weak, and so was any animal that depended upon it. <br>Owen came finally to a wagon trace which seemed to strike a chord in his memory. Turning in the saddle for a different perspective, he thought he recalled using this road when he had traveled eastward two years and more ago with his brother Ethan, eager to join the fighting before it could all be finished without them. He found familiarity in the pitch of the gentle hills, the steeple of a distant church, the lay of a neglected cornfield with a gully started at its lower end, gradually carrying away the fertile topsoil with every rain. <br>A mile ahead he saw a string of large wagons moving ponderously toward him. They reminded him of the long military supply trains he had seen early in the war, trains that had gradually shortened as the Confederacy found it difficult to keep filling them. These, he saw as he came nearer, were heavy freight wagons paired in tandem, each pair drawn by four spans of big draft horses and mules. He pulled out of the trail to yield them room. A tired-looking middle-aged man on horseback rode up to him. He gave Owen's bandaged arm a moment's study. <br>"Howdy, soldier," he said pleasantly. "Where you bound?" <br>Owen said, "Home. I'm Owen Danforth. You'd be Jake Tisdale, wouldn't you?" <br>Tisdale blinked. "Owen?" His eyes narrowed for a longer, more careful look. "Damned if you ain't. Wouldn't of knowed you, son. You've changed a right smart." <br>"So've you. When I left here you was farmin' on the river. You in the freightin' business now?" <br>Tisdale nodded. "War duty. I was too old to tote a rifle, and they said I'd do the government more service haulin' freight. I take cotton bales down to the Rio Grande and ferry them across to Mexico. Confederacy trades them to French and Englishmen for war supplies. The Yankees can bottle up the Texas ports, but they can't do nothin' about us tradin' in Mexico." He pointed his chin toward the lead wagon, its wide-rimmed wheels raising dust as they labored by. "I come north with guns and ammunition and such." <br>Owen had heard about the cotton trains. "I been told the Yankees invaded Brownsville from the sea to put a stop to this." <br>"They did. But we cross the Rio farther west, where their patrols can't reach. Then we travel down the river on the Mexican side and thumb our noses as we go by. Makes them madder'n hell." Tisdale looked at Owen's arm again. "If you're lookin' for work, I believe I can find somethin' you could do with one arm." <br>Owen shrugged. "Maybe later, after I see how things go with my folks. You seen them, Mr. Tisdale?" <br>Tisdale shook his head. "I been on the trail too much. It's all I can do to spend a night with the wife and young'uns when I pass through." He frowned. "I hear things, though. Seems like your old daddy's still got notions against the war. There's some fire-eatin' patriots that'd do him bodily harm if somebody was to just lead the way." <br>Owen grimaced, suddenly not sure he was in a hurry to be home. "I ought to've known he wouldn't see reason." <br>Tisdale seemed hesitant to speak "I <i>heard</i> you and him had a considerable disagreement when you left for the army." <br>"I was of age to make up my mind. So was my brother." <br>"Maybe the Lord's sent you at a good time. You bein' a wounded soldier come home, maybe the hotheads'll stand back and leave him alone. But you watch out, son. Things are touchy. There's been men killed for sayin' less than your daddy has." <br>Tisdale shook Owen's hand and fell into the dusty wake of the last wagon. Owen watched the train move away in its own slow time, and a sourness settled into his stomach. <br>Hell of a situation to come home to. <br>Gauging the position of the sun, he decided he should reach Uncle Zachariah Danforth's farm before dark. The tall bay horse needed rest, and Owen could better face the confrontation with his father if he arrived home fresh. Uncle Zach had been of the same mind as Andrew Danforth on the confederacy question and the war, but at least he could be tolerant of an opposing viewpoint. Tolerance was a seldom thing with Owen's father. <br>The left arm felt hot beneath the bandages, which had needed changing for the last two days. Now and then a sharp pain grabbed him with the violence of a cotton hook. Odd, he could not remember feeling any pain when the Yankee saber had slashed him. He had been caught up in the shouting fury of hand-to-hand fighting. Something about the fever of battle masked the pain until the excitement had peaked. Only then had he realized his arm was hanging uselessly, blood spilling from his sleeve and running down a dead-numb hand that could not feel its warmth. The first doctor who examined him was ready to saw the bone in two. Owen had fought like a cornered badger until the doctor turned away in his frustration, telling him to go ahead and the if that be his choice. Blood poisoning had nearly killed Owen, but he still had his arm. He could not yet tell whether it would ever be of use again. <br>He felt no rancor toward the doctor or even toward tile faceless Yankee who struck him and rode on. He had no idea, for the excitement had been intense, whether the Yankee had been small or large, young or old. He did not know if the man had survived the fight. Many on both sides had not. <br> <i>I'll be home tomorrow</i>, he told himself. His mother would know what to do, what would be needed to draw out the fever and the poison. If the arm was to be saved, his mother would know how. <br>When the fever had been at its worst, the lifeline to which Owen had clung most tightly was an obligation to set things right with Andrew Danforth, to reconcile for careless and angry recriminations flung at their parting. Perhaps tomorrow he would find better words. <br>The sun was twenty minutes gone behind the great oak trees on the river when a turn of the trail and a clearing of the scattered timber showed him Zach Dan-forth's cabin in the dusk. Before he thought better, he touched spurs to the big horse and tried to bully a faster trot from him. He slowed, knowing he had taxed the animal too much already. <br>Uncle Zach had been a widower longer than Owen could remember. His only child had died at birth, along with its mother. Zach had helplessly watched her die and could never bring himself to put another woman through that jeopardy. <br>Riding toward the double cabin, Owen kept his eyes on the open dog run between its two sections. He shouted, "Hello the house. Anybody home?" <br>A gruff voice spoke behind him. "Turn slow, soldier, and show me who you are." <br>Owen turned quickly, stiffening at sight of a shotgun. Zachariah Danforth stood beside a small shed where he sheltered his harness, saddles and other goods that needed protection from the weather. He raised the shotgun to let Owen see the muzzle of it. <br>Owen swallowed. "Uncle Zach, it's me." <br>"Owen?" Suspicious eyes stared from under a wilted felt hat that had been old when Owen was yet a boy. "Come a little closer and let me see." <br>Owen was drawn thin, and he had not been able to shave himself decently since he had taken that saber wound. He wore a beard that had not felt scissors or razor since he had left the Georgia cotton warehouse that served as a field hospital. "It's me sure enough, Uncle Zach." <br>The eyes flickered with glad recognition, and the shotgun dropped to arm's length. "Git down, boy. I was lookin' for company, but you ain't what I expected." <br>Owen dismounted slowly, clinging to the saddle after his feet were on the ground, for his knees threatened to buckle. Zach was about to embrace him when he noticed the bound arm. He still almost broke Owen's right shoulder with a loving squeeze of his big hand. "You been hurt, boy." <br>"That's why they let me come home." <br>Zach's long silence and pained eyes spoke of sympathy. He had always provided a sympathetic refuge when Owen had one of his many quarrels with his father. "I'll put your horse up and find him a bait of oats.

Advertised as her "first novel," <i>Harvest</i> jumped onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list and thus legions of new fans were introduced to the work of this talented author. Gerritsen's second thriller, <i>Life Support</i>, is as moving as any of her romances. Dr. Toby Harper works the night shift in an emergency room. More comfortable with the steady horror and tedium of emergency care than with a normal lifestyle, Toby alienates herself socially from her peers and from her sister. She spends her daytime hours alone with her mother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. When elderly Alzheimer's patients from the same retirement home start dying mysteriously, Toby is the only one suspicious enough to investigate. As a result she finds herself, her mother, and her own sanity at risk.The overnight ER rotation at Springer Hospital is a calm one, which suits Dr. Toby Harper just fine. While Toby is fiercely proud of the stripes she earned as a resident in a big-city ER, she's come to appreciate the pace at Springer. But no hospital could have been prepared for the man Toby admits one quiet night. Delirious and in critical condition from a possible viral infection of the brain, he barely responds to treatment. And then he disappears without a trace. <p>Under fire from the hospital administration for literally losing a patient, and fearful that she's missed a life-threatening diagnosis, Toby knows she must find the patient. Her hunt is intensified when a second delirious patient dies in the hospital's care. But even more chilling is the discovery that the infection can only be spread through direct tissue exchange.</p></p><h2>Men at Arms: A Novel of Discworld</h2><p>It was a dwarf's dream. Captain Vimes of the Watch was retiring. That put Corporal Carrot in charge of the new recruits guarding Ankh-Morpork, Discworld's greatest city, from the Barbarian Tribes, Miscellaneous Marauders, unlicensed Thieves, and such. It was a big job, particularly for an adopted dwarf who was so homesick for the gold mines of Ramtop that he often locked himself in the dark room and hit himself on the head with an axe-handle, just for fun. <p> It was a young lord's nightmare. Edward, the 37th Lord d'Eath, newly graduated from the School for Assassins (the ideal institution for those whose rank is higher than their intelligence), had made an astonishing discovery. Ankh-Morpork, kingless for generations, and ruled by Disorganized Crime, had a sovereign! The new king just had to be convinces that he was, in fact, a king. </p><p> Corporal Carrot had a job. </p><p> Lord d'Eath had a Task. </p><p> And so began the most awesome epic encounter of all time, or at least all afternoon, in which good and evil, greed and honor, trolls and dwarves, dogs and bells and swamp dragons would clash, crash, toll, bark, shimmer, and simmer. The fate of a city, indeed a kingdom--nay, a very universe!--was to depend on a young man's courage, an ancient sword's magic, and three-legged poodle's bladder. </p><p> Don't look so surprised. This is Discworld, where anything can happen. </p><p> Which means that everything always does.</p></p><p>Another wild romp through Discworld!

Such honest, forthright wrestling with evil and the silence of God has intrigued a wide range of readers, both religious and nonreligious. Surprisingly, the earliest fathers showed little interest in the book of Job. Not until Origen in the early third century is there much evidence of any systematic treatment of the book, and most of Origen&#39;s treatment is known to us only from the catenae. More intense interest came at the end of the fourth century and the beginning of the fifth. The excerpts in this collection focus on systematic treatment. Among Greek texts are those from Origen, Didymus the Blind, Julian the Arian, John Chrysostom, Hesychius of Jerusalem and Olympiodorus. Among Latin sources we find Julian of Eclanum, Philip the Priest and Gregory the Great. Among Syriac sources we find Ephrem the Syrian and Isho?dad of Merv, some of whose work is made available here for the first time in English.

Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation.

After decades of concealment from genocidal attacks on his people in California, Ishi (ca. 1860&#x2013;1916) came out of hiding in 1911 and lived the last five years of his life in the University of California Anthropological Museum in San Francisco.&nbsp;Contributors to this volume illuminate Ishi the person, his relationship to anthropologist A.

Coetzee, winner of two Booker Prizes and the 2003 Nobel Prize for Literature, the world of receiving literary awards and giving speeches must be such a commonplace that he has put the circuit at the center of his book, <i>Elizabeth Costello</i>. As the work opens, in fact, the eponymous Elizabeth, a fictional novelist, is in Williamstown, Pennsylvania, to receive the Stowe Award. For her speech at the Williamstown's Altona College she chooses the tired topic, "What Is Realism?" and quickly loses her audience in her unfocused discussion of Kafka. From there, readers follow her to a cruise ship where she is virtually imprisoned as a celebrity lecturer to the ship's guests. Next, she is off to Appleton College where she delivers the annual Gates Lecture. Later, she will even attend a graduation speech. <p> Coetzee has made this project difficult for himself. Occasional writing--writing that includes graduation speeches, acceptance speeches, or even academic lectures--is a less than auspicious form around which to build a long work of fiction. A powerful central character engaged in a challenging stage of life might sustain such a work. Yet, at the start, Coetzee declares that Elizabeth is "old and tired," and her best book, <i>The House on Eccles Street</i> is long in her past. <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> lacks a progressive plot and offers little development over the course of each new performance at the lectern. Readers are given Elizabeth fully formed with only brief glimpses of her past sexual dalliances and literary efforts. </p><p> In the end, <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> seems undecided about its own direction. When Elizabeth is brought to a final reckoning at the gates of the afterlife, she begins to suspect that she is actually in hell, "or at least purgatory: a purgatory of clich�s." Perhaps Coetzee's <i>Elizabeth Costello</i>, which can be read as an extended critique of clich�d writing, is a portrait of this purgatory. While some readers may find Coetzee's philosophical prose sustenance enough on the journey, some will turn back at the gate. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Elizabeth Costello</b> is a humane, moral, and uncompromising creation. <br> <br>The subject of J.M. Coetzee's latest work of fiction is an Australian writer of international renown -- f�ted, studied and honoured. Famous principally for an early novel that established her reputation and from which, it seems, she will never escape, she has reached the stage, late in life, where her remaining function is to be venerated and applauded. <br> <br>One of a new breed of intellectual nomads, her life has become a series of engagements in sterile conference rooms throughout the world -- a private consciousness obliged to reveal itself to a curious public: the presentation of a major award at an American college where she is required to deliver a lecture; a sojourn as the writer-in-residence on a cruise liner during which she encounters a fellow guest lecturer, an African poet also employed to divert the passengers. Then there is a disquieting appearance at a writers' conference in Amsterdam where she finds the subject of her talk unexpectedly among the audience. She has made her life's work the study of other people, yet now it is she who is the object of scrutiny. But, for her, what matters is the continuing search for a means of articulating her vision and the verdict of future generations. <br> <br>J.M. Coetzee's latest work of fiction offers us a profound and delicate vision of literary celebrity, artistry and the private life of the mind. <br> <br> <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Edible Woman</h2><p>Marian is determined to be ordinary.

But as Car and Driver columnist Yates points out in this captivating, demythologizing biography, none of Ferrari's racing cars "was a glittering example of daring technology," and he had almost no hand in the making of the later road cars that bore his name. Revealed as a hot-tempered megalomaniac given to loud belching and countless amorous conquests, Ferrari fathered an illegitimate child and led a shadowy second life as a respite from the "simmering hatred" of his marriage. He portrayed himself as a loyal "motorized knight-errant," defending Italy's national honor, but in Yates's esimate he was interested solely in winning races and sometimes pushed his drivers to dangerous extremes. Yates deftly records the carnage of major races, business wheeling and dealing, and the political dimensions of motor racing from the pre-WW II Rome-Berlin Axis to today's ribbon-waving nationalism.

The Chumash lived in Southern California along a Pacific Ocean coastal region between San Luis Obispo and Malibu, where they were an important tribe before the arrival of Europeans. A collection of nine legends about Coyote and his friends as told by the Chumash Indians. These fanciful stories tell the adventures of Coyote and his friends, whom the Chumash believed were once people. Coyote reacts to different situations with his characteristic cunning, trickery, and out-and-out foolishness. The myths were a way for the Indians to explain their world and pass on their traditions to their children. Many of the myths were long and complex. The editor, Kay Sanger, has retold them in a style that will appeal to youngsters in the upper elementary grades and junior high school. Detailed illustrations show artifacts such as a stone whale carving, a wooden plank canoe, and an asphaltum-lined water basket from the Chumash people.</p><p></p><h2>Whever You Are My Love Will Find You</h2><p>Love is the greatest gift we have to give our children.

How Antonia emerges from her private cocoon is the subject of this engaging novel ... A companion piece to Celia&#39;s House, Listening Valley follows Antonia from sheltered childhood to the joyous serenity she attains as a young woman.</p><p>D.E. Stevenson (1892-1973) had an enormously successful writing career; between 1923 and 1970, four million copies of her books were sold in Britain and three million in the United States.<p><strong>Chapter One <br> The House with the High Wall </strong></p> <p>Most people, looking back at their childhood, see it as a misty country half forgotten or only to be remembered through an evocative sound or scent, but some episodes of those short years remain clear and brightly colored like a landscape seen through the wrong end of a telescope. It was thus that Louise Melville was always to remember the house with the high wall and the adventure connected with it. Antonia was to remember it, too, but not so vividly, for really and truly it was Lou's adventure. Lou was the adventurous one.</p> <p>The house with the high wall was within five minutes' walk of their own house (the house in which they had been born and in which they lived with their father and mother), but, whereas their own house was one of many, all exactly alike, and was situated in a square with a small and very sooty garden in front, the house with the high wall stood alone, surrounded by a solid gray stone wall and half hidden by trees. In the summer a laburnum flung careless streams of golden blossom over the top of the wall and a snow-white hawthorn tree filled the air with sweetness.</p> <p>The children often walked around that way in the afternoon, and they used to linger as they passed the tall wooden door in the hope that it would open and give them a glimpse of the garden and the house, but Nannie did not approve of lingering here. She never said anything but always hurried them on...</p> <p>Lou and Tonia did not ask why, of course, for they were aware that Nannie would not tell them. Nannie was an adept at the art of turning questions aside-questions that she could not or would not answer.</p> <p>"P'raps an ogre lives there," Tonia said. "An ogre who eats children for his breakfast."</p> <p>"Or p'raps a wicked magician who would turn us into frogs," countered Lou with relish.</p> <p>They did not really believe in ogres and magicians, for they were sensible children, but it was fun to pretend to believe in these monsters of iniquity and it was an absorbing topic of conversation.</p> <p>"Grown-ups are queer," said Tonia, referring to Nannie's inexplicable behavior.</p> <p>"Yes," agreed Lou. "Yes, they get queer ideas. I think Nannie must have gotten a queer idea about the house with the high wall."</p> <p>"Mother has it, too," said Tonia, nodding. "Mother wouldn't let me look at the house when we drove past yesterday."</p> <p>One blustery day toward the end of March, the east wind was sweeping through the streets of Edinburgh, raising the dust in clouds and playing all sorts of impish tricks with the hats and skirts of the citizens. The children were out with Nannie as usual, but there was an unusual feeling in Lou's heart. Perhaps it was the sunshine and the breeze, or perhaps it was the fact that the flower shop windows were full of daffodils, showing that spring was really on its way. Whatever it was, Lou's heart felt light and her feet wanted to dance...and when she got to the corner of the high gray wall she took to her heels and ran. Tonia followed, of course, she always followed Lou, and Nannie was left panting along behind.</p> <p>The children stopped at the big brown door and looked at each other, smiling.</p> <p>"I won," said Lou, breathlessly.</p> <p>"You-started-first," said Tonia, more breathlessly still.</p> <p>"You could have started first if you'd wanted-"</p> <p>"But I didn't know," began Tonia in reproachful tones.</p> <p>At this moment the big brown door swung open and a lady appeared. She stepped out into the street and looked up and down-as if she were looking for someone. She was dressed in a soft blue coat with gray furs and a little hat made of gray feathers, but it was her face that riveted the eyes of Tonia and Lou; her face was beautiful. It was pink and white like the Dresden china lady in the drawing room cabinet, and her eyes were bright and brown and sparkling with life.</p> <p>The lady stopped and smiled. "Two dear little mice!" she exclaimed. She might have said more-she looked as if she were going to say more-but Nannie was just behind and swept the children on.</p> <p>"The idea!" said Nannie under her breath.</p> <p>They talked about the lady all the way home, walking along in front of Nannie very sedately.</p> <p>"What a lovely smell she had!" whispered Lou.</p> <p>"It was violets," said Tonia, whispering back.</p> <p>"She was like a picture-"</p> <p>"Like a queen-that's what I thought."</p> <p>"She called us mice."</p> <p>"Because of our gray coats, of course."</p> <p>For days on end they talked of nothing else, for the sudden appearance of the picture lady and her unusual beauty had kindled their imaginations; unfortunately they had been so entranced that neither of them had looked in through the open door, so the house with the high wall was as mysterious as ever-perhaps even more mysterious.</p> <p>"She lives there, of course," said Lou. "It must be lovely if she lives there. How I wish I had remembered to look!"</p> <p>Tonia said nothing for she was content with the mystery. It was pleasant to speculate, to make up stories about the garden and the house and the beautiful picture lady who lived there...but Lou was different. Lou always wanted to know.</p> <p>It was the end of May or perhaps the beginning of June when Nannie went home for the weekend. She went home to see her mother who was "getting on" (as Nannie put it), and while she was away the children's mother looked after them and Maggie, the housemaid, put them to bed. Maggie was young and enjoyed having games with the children, so, although they were fond of Nannie, her absence was a pleasant change.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, Lou and Tonia went down to the drawing room dressed in their best frocks-blue Liberty smocks, the color of their eyes. Mrs. Melville intended to have them with her for tea, but after about twenty minutes of their company she changed her mind, for they were in a tiresome sort of mood and she could not be bothered with them. If only one of them had been a boy, thought Mrs. Melville, looking at her daughters regretfully, or even if one of them were really interesting; they were both rather dull. The children of Mrs. Melville's friends were bright and entertaining and frequently made amusing remarks, but neither Lou nor Tonia ever said anything worth repeating.</p> <p>"I think you might go upstairs and play with the dollhouse," suggested Mrs. Melville. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? And I'll tell Maggie to take your tea up to the nursery."</p> <p>"Do you love Mother?" asked Tonia, as they toiled upstairs together.</p> <p>"Why, of course," replied Lou in horrified tones. "It would be frightfully wicked not to love Mother. You love her, don't you?"</p> <p>"Of course," said Tonia hastily...but did she? Perhaps she was frightfully wicked. How could you be sure?</p> <p>"And Father," continued Lou in earnest tones. "You love Father, don't you?"</p> <p>"Oh, of course," agreed Tonia. She hesitated and then added in a doubtful voice, "But we don't see him often, do we?"</p> <p>"He buys your clothes, Tonia. He buys your food. You would starve if Father didn't buy you things."</p> <p>"Yes, of course," said Tonia for the third time, but without much conviction.</p> <p>They had arrived at the nursery. Tonia opened the dollhouse, but Lou ran across to the window and leaned out. There were bars across the window, but you could get your head between the bars-if Nannie was not there-and you could look down into the street, far below. People were walking along, dressed in their Sunday clothes, and it was amusing because you could see their hats and a dumpy sort of figure beneath. A dog ran across the street and a black-and-white cat sprang onto the railing of the garden and crouched there, spitting with rage. There was a hawthorn tree in the garden, and the afternoon sun was shining on the snow-white blossoms with a golden light.</p> <p>"Let's go out," said Lou.</p> <p>"Alone!" exclaimed Tonia in amazement.</p> <p>"Why not?" demanded Lou. Her cheeks were suddenly pink, and her eyes were sparkling. Her very hair seemed full of excitement; a few moments ago it had been lying flat with boredom, but now her golden curls were bobbing and dancing as if they were alive. "What could happen to us, Tonia?" she continued. "I suppose you're frightened of getting lost or something. We always go for a walk in the afternoons-it's good for us. I'll take care of you," added Lou grandly.</p> <p>Five minutes later the hall door opened, and two little girls in little blue frocks came out and walked sedately down the steps. Nothing had been arranged about the direction of their walk, but neither of them showed any hesitation. They turned to their left and proceeded upon their way, hand in hand.</p> <p>The wall was just as mysterious as ever, and the brown door was shut. Lou and Tonia walked past very slowly, turned at the corner, and walked back.</p> <p>"It won't open," said Tonia, breaking the silence. "I know it won't open; I've got a sort of feeling-"</p> <p>Lou said nothing. She reached up and pulled the bell. Far in the distance, there was a jangling noise that died away into silence.</p> <p>"Lou!"</p> <p>"I had to. I just had to, Tonia."</p> <p>"But what will you say?"</p> <p>"I don't know-but I must see inside," declared Lou breathlessly.</p> <p>They waited for a few moments and then they heard footsteps approaching and the door swung open...it was the lady they had seen before, the picture lady. Today she was all in pale gray with a string of pearls around her neck, and her dark hair was waved and curled.</p> <p>The lady looked at her visitors in some surprise and then she smiled. "It's the two little mice!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>Lou and Tonia were dumb. They walked into the garden, and the door was shut behind them. It was not a big garden, but it was even more wonderful than they had imagined, for it was full of sunshine and flowers. There was a paved courtyard with a pool in the middle, and all around the paved space was high rockery, covered with pink and yellow and purple flowers; they looked like colored waterfalls streaming down between the stones. At one side was a swinging garden seat with a gaily striped red and white canopy, and in front of it was a tea table with a white lace cloth and silver that sparkled in the sun. A fat lady was sitting in the swinging seat and a young man in white flannels was sitting near her in a deck chair, reading a paper.</p> <p>Lou and Tonia stood there, hand in hand, and gazed about them.</p> <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the young man, throwing down his paper. "Good heavens, where did you find them, Mother?"</p> <p>"They're perfect," declared the fat lady, holding up a lorgnette.</p> <p>"Yes, quite perfect," agreed the picture lady, laughing to herself in a pleased way. "I thought you'd like them, Daisy. Wasn't it clever of me to produce them for you on a dull Sunday afternoon?"</p> <p>"It's never dull when you're about," declared the young man.</p> <p>"It was very clever of you, Wanda," declared the fat lady.</p> <p>"They're two little mice, you know," said the picture lady, nodding. "Two dear little mice."</p> <p>"Not mice, Wanda," objected the fat lady.</p> <p>"No," agreed the young man. "Aunt Daisy is right. They aren't mice. I can't quite make up my mind what they are-babes in the wood, perhaps."</p> <p>"They're Alices in Wonderland," said Aunt Daisy, closing her lorgnette with a snap.</p> <p>A short silence ensued. It was broken by the young man. "Can they talk?" he inquired in a grave, interested voice.</p> <p>"I don't think so," replied the picture lady. "But they don't have to talk, do they? I mean, they're so entrancing to look at."</p> <p>"Entrancing," agreed Aunt Daisy with a sigh. "And how fortunate they are! They go together so beautifully, don't they? One fair and one dark-and they both have dark blue eyes and rose-leaf complexions. When we were young, you were so much fairer."</p> <p>"I couldn't help it, Daisy," said the picture lady regretfully.</p> <p>Lou and Tonia had never heard this sort of conversation before (it was entirely different from the conversation of their mother's friends), but the whole adventure was so strange, so different from everyday life, that nothing would have surprised them.</p> <p>"Of course we can talk," said Lou, waking suddenly from the daze into which she had fallen.</p> <p>"They can talk!" exclaimed the young man in amazement.</p> <p>"Perhaps they can eat and drink," suggested Aunt Daisy.</p> <p>The young man immediately rose, produced two cushions, and, putting them on the broad stone rim of the pool, invited the children to sit down. The picture lady poured out two cups of tea and offered them a plate of chocolate �clairs.</p> <p>"We usually start with bread and butter," said Lou, doubtfully.</p> <p>"We always start with �clairs," said the young man gravely. "You see we haven't been very well brought up."</p> <p>"Speak for yourself, Jack," interposed Aunt Daisy with asperity. "Your mother and I were very well brought up. We always started with bread and butter, didn't we, Wanda?"</p> <p>"You can be too well brought up," replied her sister sadly. "I mean, you have so much further to backslide-"</p> <p>"But respectability is so dull-"</p> <p>"So difficult to achieve-"</p> <p>"Who wants to achieve it?" asked Jack. "Give me chocolate �clairs every time."</p> <p>The picture lady looked at him and smiled.</p> <p>"Are they twins, I wonder," said Aunt Daisy suddenly.</p> <p>"No, we aren't," declared Lou.</p> <p>"They aren't twins." Jack nodded. "As a matter of fact, I was pretty certain they were not. The pretty one is the elder."</p> <p>"They're both pretty," objected Aunt Daisy, "but of course I know what you mean. The fair one is more obviously pretty."</p> <p>"She's adorable," said Jack.</p> <p>"The dark one has better features," said his mother, "but you always prefer blonds."</p> <p>"Except one," put in Jack, smiling at her affectionately.</p> <p>"Sentimental nonsense," grumbled Aunt Daisy, handing in her cup for more tea.</p> <p>Neither Lou nor Tonia had any sense of social obligation, so they sat and ate chocolate �clairs and made no attempt to join in the conversation of their hosts. They listened, of course, in a slightly dazed manner, and not much of it escaped them. It was very pleasant in the garden, warm and bright. Bees buzzed among the flowers, and an occasional car passed by outside the high wall and hooted at the corner. Presently, the church bells began to ring for evening service, and the picture lady rose.</p> <p>"Are you going to church?" asked Lou.</p> <p>She smiled and shook her head. "It's time for you to go home, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Let's keep them," suggested Jack. "This is Liberty Hall. They would like to live here-"</p> <p>"Yes, let's keep them," agreed Aunt Daisy.</p> <p>"I'm afraid you can't," said Lou. "Mother might wonder where we had gone, and Nannie is coming home tomorrow-so you see-"</p> <p>"I see," said Jack sadly.</p> <p>Their hosts accompanied them to the door and shook hands with them. "Come back soon," said Jack.</p> <p>"Nannie won't let them," said the picture lady.</p> <p>Aunt Daisy laughed and said, "Oh, you know who they are!"</p> <p>Lou and Tonia walked home in silence, for there was so much to think about that they had no words at all. It was not until they had regained the familiar haven of the nursery and had seated ...</p></p><h2>Years Of The Elephant</h2><p>Madam ... Sir ... May we come in? ...

Long-time Kenya resident Trzebinski (The Kenya Pioneers, 1986; Silence will Speak, 1978), who knew Markham, draws on letters, diaries, and copious interviews to tell his subject's story. Throughout, we're reminded of Markham's difficult childhood: Abandoned by her wealthy English mother at age two, young Beryl was left to be raised by her father, his mistress, and the Africans on their farm. Markham received little formal education and even fewer notions of conventional piety and morality, but her father did teach her to ride and train horses, a skill that would provide her with a living throughout her life. But despite Trzebinski's patronizing plea that Markham's behavior was affected by her being more African than European, the aviatrix proved to be single-minded and often cruel in pursuit of what she wanted. She abandoned three husbands, one son, and numerous lovers (the Prince of Wales and his younger brother each became her lover while visiting Kenya); she betrayed friends like Karen Blixen, whose great love, Denys Finch Hatton, she seduced behind Blixen's back; and she never admitted that her third husband, Hollywood screenwriter Raoul Schumacher, wrote West with the Night. Trzebinski's evidence for all this is well documented and very persuasive--but to balance the heavy indictment, the author also emphasizes Markham's great courage, beauty, and charm. All the seamy settler shenanigans of life in Kenyan highlands are reprised in this gossipy, exhaustively researched Beryl Dearest. Another cult figure bites the dust. (Photos) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Svelte, tall, glamorous, vain, nervy pilot Beryl Markham (1902-1986) won fame with her transatlantic solo flight in 1936. In a magnificent, enthralling biography, Trzebinski peels away the layers of myth in Markham's popular memoir, West with the Night , to reveal a sexually insatiable woman whose charisma concealed a selfish, ruthless, insecure self-doubter. Trzebinski knew Markham for many years in Kenya, where the future ace pilot, racehorse trainer and royal courtesan to Edward, Prince of Wales and to the Duke of Gloucester was raised by her English father, a rampant colonialist, and by Masai servants. Beryl's mother abandoned her at age four, instilling a lifelong mistrust of women. The gutsy aviator's obsessive affair with rakish pilot/safari hunter Denys Finch Hatton, whose other mistress was Danish Baroness Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen), is fully disclosed here. (Trzebinski charted the Hatton/Blixen romance in Silence Will Speak. ) Also presented is compelling evidence that West with the Night was written by Markham's third husband, Hollywood ghostwriter Raoul Schumacher, a contention that could trigger a lively literary controversy because, in her 1987 Markham biography, Straight on Till Morning , Mary S. Lovell vehemently disputes this.

Many critics at the time of publication said the Catechism lacked sufficient coverage of the social teaching of the Catholic Church, teaching on justice, peace and human rights. To remedy this, the Vatican commissioned this remarkable new publication from the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and Burns &amp; Oates are now its proud publishers. Throughout the course of her history, and particularly in the last hundred years, the Church has never failed, in the words of Pope Leo XIII, to speak the words that are hers with regard to questions concerning life in society. To maintain this tradition, Pope John Paul II has for his part published three great encyclicals that represent fundamental stages of Catholic thought in this area. Moreover, numerous Bishops in every part of the world have contributed to a deeper understanding of the Church's social doctrine as have numerous scholars. This book also shows the value of Catholic social teaching as an instrument of evangelisation because it places the human person and society in relationship with the light of the Gospel. The principles of the Church's social doctrine, which are based on the natural law, are then seen to be confirmed and strengthened in the faith of the Church by the Gospel of Christ. The Pope hopes that the present publication will help humanity in its quest for the common good.</p><p></p><h2>Odin&#39;s Ravens (The Blackwell Pages, 2)</h2><p><i>Seven kids, Thor's hammer, and a whole lot of Valkyries are the only things standing against the end of the world.</i> <br><br>When thirteen-year-olds Matt Thorsen and Fen and Laurie Brekke, modern-day descendants of Thor and Loki, discovered they were fated to take the places of the Norse gods in an epic battle against the apocalypse, they thought they knew how things would play out.

They believe that the shafts and intricate man-made flooding system hold the secret to a treasure of untold wealth. Although millions have been spent, bitter feuds have erupted, and men have died, the treasure has remained as elusive as the answers to who built the labyrinth, why and how it was constructed, and the nature of the treasure itself. Until now.</p> <p>In his second book on the Oak Island mystery, William Crooker meticulously sifts through the evidence unearthed by treasure hunters on the island, past and present. Then, armed with some starling new discoveries, he neatly fits the pieces together to offer a plausible solution to the baffling puzzle of Oak Island.</p></p><p>William Crooker, a graduate of Dalhousie University, was a Land Surveyor and Professional Engineer. He is the author of a number of books including Oak Island Gold, The Oak Island Quest, Tracking Treasure, and Pirates of the North Atlantic.Treasure hunters have been tunneling into Oak Island off the coast of Nova Scotia since 1795, yet no one has found the fabulous treasure that legend says is buried there. It all began when a young explorer found a clearing on the island that appeared to have been worked. Throw in local rumors of pirates and buried treasure, and the digging started. The original excavators did leave many clues which convinced treasure seekers that something was buried on Oak Island, but every time the digging reached a certain depth, the hole filled with sea water. Crooker, an engineer and surveyor, presents both a thorough historical review of the various digs and a look at all the theories about the treasure. Based on his research, he maintains that it was looted by the British from Havana in 1762 and put on the island for safekeeping. Prospectors are still digging, but until the "treasure" is found, the mystery remains.

With a dark cacophony of associations like fright, dread, horror, panic, alarm, anxiety, and terror, fear is universally understood as one of the most basic and powerful of human emotions, obtaining a nearly palpable and overwhelming substance in today's world.<br><br>In this groundbreaking book, acclaimed historian and prize-winning author Joanna Bourke covers the landscape of fear over the past two hundred years: From the nineteenth century dread of being buried alive a subject dear to the heart of Edgar Allen Poe to the current worry over being able to die when one chooses; from the diagnoses of phobias and anxieties produced by psychotherapists and lovingly catalogued, to the role of popular culture and media in inciting panic and dread; from the horrors of the nuclear age to the fear of twenty-first century terrorism, <i>Fear</i> tells the story of anguish in modern times.<br><br>A blend of social and cultural history with psychology, philosophy, and popular science, this astonishing book exhaustively researched and beautifully written offers strikingly original insights into the mind and worldview of the long twentieth century&#x201d; from one of the most brilliant scholars of our time.<br></p><p>Joanna Bourke is a professor of history at Birkbeck College in London. Her book An Intimate History of Killing received critical acclaim, winning the Wolfson History PrizeFrom death and disaster to dangerous technologies, the number of things out there to fear is countless, argues British historian Bourke (<i>An Intimate History of Killing</i>), who surveys a pitted landscape of dread and panic over the past two centuries in this imaginative social, psychological and cultural history. She traces how what we fear changes over time as a function of broader social anxieties and stresses. In the hierarchical Britain of the early 20th century, for instance, a lower-class accent was regarded with unparalleled horror; today, no one cares. The Victorians were terrified of sudden, natural death; today, at a time when people worry about "the excessive prolongation of life after all pleasure has been removed," being killed instantly and without warning is for many the preferred way to go. For us, the most feared thing of all is the terrorist, the "equivalent to the plague of earlier times or the Satan of religion." Though Bourke performs sterling service, painstakingly picking over usually bypassed sources and materials for hidden clues as to what scares us, she indulges the fashionable fallacy that because some fears&#x2014;of terrorism, for example, since 9/11&#x2014;have been exaggerated and even occasionally exploited, there is therefore nothing at all to fear but, presumably, fear itself. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A devoted physician who has endured grueling years of training and worked continuously in the service of others, he is now a partner in an exclusive concierge medical practice. No longer forced to see more and more patients while spending less and less time with each one just to keep his office door open, he provides the kind of medical care he has been prepared to do, lavishing twenty-four-hour availability and personalized attention on his handpicked patients.

Adam Ardrey, who stumbled upon some of the hidden sources of Merlin&#39;s life while researching the history of a Scottish clan, offers compelling evidence that links a very real Merlin figure into the histories of other real and prominent sixth century figures. Finding Merlin uncovers new evidence and reexamines the old. The places where Merlin was born, lived, died, and was buried are identified, as are the people surrounding him -- his nemesis, the fanatic Mungo, and his friend, the hero Arthur. In this impressively researched and accessibly written book, Merlin leaps from the pages of legend into history.</p><p><b>Adarm Ardrey</b> is the author of Finding Merlin: The Truth Behind the Legend of the Great Arthurian Mage, also available from Overlook. A writer and attorney, he lives in Scotland.Drawing on what he claims has been a history of suppression by England's political and religious authorities, Scottish writer Ardrey says Merlin did indeed exist but that our image of him is a myth: Merlin wasn't a wizard and King Arthur's avuncular counselor but a revered scholar, politician and military commander in central Scotland in the late sixth and early seventh centuries. Merlin was a Celt, Ardrey claims, not an Anglo-Saxon, and was not Christian but adhered to the old ways of the druids, who sought to live harmoniously with others and with nature. Together with the great warlord Arthur Mac Aedan, son of the king of Scots, Merlin led the Britons and their Scots allies against the Angles. Ardrey takes aim at Mungo, Glasgow's patron saint and Merlin's archenemy, depicting him as the ruthlessly ambitious head of a group of Catholic fundamentalists akin to the twenty-first-century Taliban, whose exploits were distorted by his 12th-century hagiographer, Jocelyn of Furness. Merlin is an enticing biographical subject, but Ardrey's pedantic style, his dull dissection of Jocelyn, and his long-winded digressions into the cross-dressing of Mungo's father or why Merlin couldn't have built Stonehenge don't enhance his argument. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Worcester, Mass., the children met their immigrant father Christos Gatzoyiannis, separated for years from the clan. Expecting a tycoon, they found instead an out-of-work short-order cook, a proud, touchy, gruff autocrat whom Gage, resentfully, blamed for not getting the family out of Greece sooner. A fourth sister joined them three months later. The story of Gage's reconciliation with his father is the keynote of this wonderfully vivid autobiographical sequel to Eleni. Full of humorous, ironic, sad touches, this extraordinary, moving saga reflects one family's attempt to balance assimilation with the preservation of Old-World traditions. Halfway to becoming a petty teenaged hood, the author pulled himself together and became instead a distinguished journalist who returned to Greece in an effort to trace his mother's killers (as told in Eleni ). Photos. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Seldom has the immigrant experience been captured more emotionally than in this memoir. The "place" is America, and the "us" is the family of author Gage, who in March 1949 sailed for freedom with three of his sisters from a Greece riddled with civil war to be reunited with their father in Worcester, Massachusetts, where the family joined a large Greek contingent. Gage's story is moving and humorous, a tale of adjustment to an unknown culture, and is best characterized by a love which transcends not only the Atlantic but years of strife and trying assimilation. The narrative is excellent. Gage is a former New York Times reporter whose earlier successes include Eleni ( LJ 6/15/83), the touching story of the murder of his mother by Greek communists. The author approaches, if not exceeds, his earlier effort: this is one of the year's best books. It should be widely read; it crystallizes our sense of liberty.

" In the final volume of Anne Rice's deliciously tantalizing erotic trilogy, Beauty's adventures on the dark side of sexuality make her the bound captive of an Eastern Sultan and a prisoner in the exotic confines of the harem. As this voluptuous adult fairy tale moves toward conclusion, all Beauty's encounters with the myriad variations of sexual fantasy are presented in a sensuous, rich prose that intensifies this exquisite rendition of Love's secret world, and makes the Beauty series and incomparable study of erotica. In it, Anne Rice, writing as A.N. Roquelaure, makes the forbidden side of passion a doorway into the hidden regions of the psyche and the heart.</p></p><p><b>PREFACE</b> <p></p> <p>I&#x2019;ve always loved the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, and found something erotic at its core. The Prince awakens Beauty with a kiss. And I thought, all right, what if he brought a kind of liberation, an induction into a world of bizarre yet irresistible delights? It has to be remembered that within the frame of a sadomasochistic fantasy like the Beauty trilogy, the readers are invited to identify with and enjoy the predicament of the slaves. The books aren&#x2019;t about literal cruelty; they&#x2019;re about surrender, the fun of imagining you have no choice but to enjoy sex. Beauty&#x2019;s slavery is delicious, sensuous, abandoned, and ultimately liberating. This is all part of the framework. And it seemed to work exquisitely with the old fairy tale. And of course the fairy tale removes us from everyday life; it removes us from the intrusion of garish headlines, literal violence, and all the ugliness of crime. We go into a gilded dream here, luscious and engulfing, in which we&#x2019;re free to imagine all sorts of things&#x2014;a fairy-tale world indeed.</p> <p>As Anne Rice, I&#x2019;m known for certain kinds of novels; the Roquelaure books retain the name Roquelaure (even with my name added) to indicate that this is something &#x201c;different.&#x201d; If Anne Rice is one kind of savory dish, well this is another entirely. And some might find it far too spicy for their taste. I don&#x2019;t like the idea of confusing or disappointing readers, so the pen name helps with that. Of course, there are many people who have read all my work, including the Roquelaure novels, and they see me as a multifaceted writer. But the Roquelaure material is erotica, without reservation, and it needs that pen name on the label, so to speak. The pen name says: Anne Rice is doing something very different here.</p> <p>I felt I needed the anonymity of the pen name to write freely, to pursue an authentic erotica without being inhibited or self-conscious. And it worked wonders to imagine myself &#x201c;cloaked&#x201d; by the name Roquelaure, which is a kind of French cloak&#x2014;named after the Frenchman who popularized it. My father was still living then and I didn&#x2019;t want him to know about the books either. In fact, there were lots of friends and relatives whom I didn&#x2019;t want to worry about as I developed the writing. There was quite a bit of exposure involved in writing such graphic sexual fantasies. It was frightening now and then, and it was thrilling. Eventually, I told my father about the books, asking him not to read them, and I did put my name on them. I adjusted completely to people knowing I&#x2019;d written them. But only after I&#x2019;d finished with the trilogy&#x2014;as I recall.</p> <p>A pen name enables you not only to cloak what you are doing from friends and family; it gives you a new freedom to do something you would not do as yourself. I have thought of writing some new erotica, and I must confess I imagined using a new pen name for it. I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;ll pursue it, but I do find the freedom of the pen name attractive.</p> <p>When the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy books were first published, they were underground books. They had the backing of a major mainstream publisher, yes, but the publication, though dignified and beautiful, was relatively quiet. But different readers embraced the books almost at once. They clearly appealed to young people, and older married people, to gays and straights. And they&#x2019;ve sold steadily ever since they first appeared. Women come up to me at signings with babies in strollers and giggle and laugh and say, &#x201c;We love your dirty books.&#x201d; People of all ages, actually, present the books to be signed.</p> <p>Why do I think these particular books have been popular? Two reasons. First, I think it is because they involve no harsh, garish violence at all. They involve game playing, really. No one is burned or cut or hurt. Certainly no one is killed. Indeed the whole sadomasochistic predicament is presented as a glorified game played out in luxurious rooms and with very attractive people, and involving very attractive slaves. There are endless motifs offered for dominance and submission, for surrender and love. It&#x2019;s like a theme park of dominance and submission, a place to go to enjoy the fantasy of being overpowered by a beautiful man or woman and delightfully compelled to surrender and feel keening pleasure, without the slightest serious harm. I think it&#x2019;s authentic to the way many who share this kind of fantasy really feel. I think what makes it work for people is the combination of the very graphic and unsparing sexual details mixed with the elegant fairy-tale world.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of hackwork pornography is written by those who don&#x2019;t share the fantasy, and they slip into hideous violence and ugliness, thinking the market wants all that, when the market never really did. Second, this is shamelessly erotic. It pulls no punches at being what it is. It&#x2019;s excessive and it is erotica. Before these books, a lot of women read what were called &#x201c;women&#x2019;s romances&#x201d; where they had to mark the few &#x201c;hot pages&#x201d; in the book. I said, well, look, try this. Maybe this is what you really want, and you don&#x2019;t have to mark the hot pages because every page is hot. Every page is about sexual fulfillment. Every page is meant to give you pleasure. There are no boring parts. Yet it&#x2019;s very &#x201c;romantic.&#x201d; And well, I think this worked.</p> <p>Lots of people enjoy imagining themselves passive, in the hands of a beautiful lover, male or female, who will force them to enjoy themselves. It&#x2019;s a common idea, and it cuts across gender and class. Men love these sorts of fantasies as much as women. And these books offer all kinds of gender combinations; women dominating men and women; men dominating men and women. The books offer ornate and seductive variations on the themes; and all of it is interwoven in stories with real characters, and again, the emphasis is on a lush, sensuous realm in which all this happens. There are very detailed descriptions of physical interaction and response; but the fairy-tale spell is sustained.</p> <p>I also went all the way with exploring the mind-set of sadomasochism as I saw it, letting the fantasy characters talk in depth about what they felt and what they enjoyed and what thrilled them as they were humiliated and overwhelmed. I suspect that for some readers, this kind of deep exploration of the mentality of the participants was entirely new.</p> <p>Is this why they appealed to so many, because people want this very combination of elements? Perhaps.</p> <p>I certainly never found the combination of elements I wanted in anyone else&#x2019;s erotica. So I offered what I could not find; a light touch; elegance; preciseness; a dreamlike kingdom; a dream in which people explore their need to be passive and to &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; that someone gorgeous and irresistible is &#x201c;making&#x201d; them do it.</p> <p>Psychiatrists have written volumes on the nature of the sadomasochistic fantasy, but when I wrote the trilogy I didn&#x2019;t know of any fiction that really enabled you to slide in it and &#x201c;play&#x201d; the way I wanted to play. So I wrote the books I couldn&#x2019;t find.</p> <p>I never thought a book as eccentric as <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> would have mass appeal. I only knew that I wanted to &#x201c;be with the vampire&#x201d; in the story, tell it from his point of view. I wanted to be inside his head and heart and reveal his voice and his pain. Now as it turned out, other people were exploring this same kind of thing&#x2014;the backstory of the villain, the monster, or the comic book hero and heroine who&#x2019;d always been described from a distance or in brittle form. People wanted to explore all kinds of super characters and hear their intimate musings. And I began to see more and more of this&#x2014;movies made in which Superman could bear his soul, and Lois Lane could really talk about what it meant to love him. The demand for such romantic fantasies grew and grew. But did I have any idea that would happen? No. I wrote what I wanted to read. Well, the same thing is true with the Beauty books.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know whether that many other people had the fantasies. After all, we didn&#x2019;t talk much about them. Only a small elite knew about the mysterious <i>Story of O</i>. But I knew I had these fantasies, and I wanted to share them, and I felt an overwhelming desire to do them &#x201c;right.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to compromise, water them down, or shrink from the most humiliating detail. I wanted to really delve into intense sensuous pleasure but put a gilded frame around a safe place for the reader from which he or she could go and come with ease.</p> <p>Of course these books have from time to time been banned. I never expected a library to stock the Beauty trilogy. I know that many libraries respond to community standards, and I just never thought about it much at all. I did notice and I couldn&#x2019;t help notice that the books sold well and steadily, and that at every signing I gave, people brought them to be signed. Recently, I&#x2019;ve signed as many copies of the Beauty books as I have of any other book I&#x2019;ve written. So I don&#x2019;t worry too much about being banned. I&#x2019;ve always shocked people. Years ago, I published a novel about the eighteenth-century castrati opera singers, titled <i>Cry to Heaven</i>. Someone brought a copy back to a bookstore in Stockton, California, and demanded his money back. &#x201c;This is pornography,&#x201d; he said. There are always some people objecting to what I do. I&#x2019;m grateful the Beauty books have been embraced and sustained over the years.</p> <p>As a feminist, I&#x2019;m very much supportive of equal rights for women in all walks of life. And that includes for me the right of every woman to write out her sexual fantasies and to read books filled with sexual fantasies that she enjoys. Men have always enjoyed all kinds of pornography. How can it be wrong for women to have the same right? We&#x2019;re sexual beings! And fantasy is where we can do the things we can&#x2019;t do in ordinary life. A woman has a right to imagine herself carried away by a handsome prince, and to choose for herself as she writes, the color of his hair and eyes, and imagine his silky voice. She has a right to make him as tall as she wants and as strong as he wants. Why not? Men have always allowed themselves such fantasies.</p> <p>Famous madams have told us for decades that powerful men love to be dominated and come to them for role playing that allows the male client to be passive. In fact, some madams have said that men who enjoy playing the passive role are often men who are very powerful in real life. Well, women today are more powerful than ever. They&#x2019;re Supreme Court judges, senators, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, executives, soldiers, cops. They can excel in all walks of life. And why shouldn&#x2019;t they be able to go home from the courtroom, the university, or the office and kick back and &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; they&#x2019;re being swept away to the Queen&#x2019;s sadomasochistic kingdom where all the fairy-tale court will watch them being ravaged by the handsome Prince?</p> <p>The literary world today is wide open for all kinds of creative endeavors. We are in a new golden age in which fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, historical drama, horror, gothic, and supernatural romance are all mainstream. Well, the same holds true now obviously for erotica. People in general are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; as enjoyers of erotic books. The novel <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> has proved this. And I am discovering that the Beauty books in spite of all their playful excess&#x2014;are for the first time going mainstream.</p> <p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t continue Beauty&#x2019;s story. I felt that ended just the way I wanted. But I might write some more. I don&#x2019;t think I did all I could do in these books, within the fantasy itself, in admitting how much the slaves enjoyed it&#x2014;how they loved it. I&#x2019;d deepen that aspect, and still keep the tension, if I did them today.</p> <p>People are much more comfortable today admitting and talking about what they enjoy in fiction and film. Much more. People are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; about sexuality, period. The whole world knows women are sensual human beings as well as men. It&#x2019;s no secret anymore that women want to read sexy fiction just as men do, and there&#x2019;s a new frankness about the varieties of fantasies one might enjoy. So many clich�s have been broken and abandoned. And this is a wonderful thing.</p> <p>&#x2014;ANNE RICE</p> <p>JUNE 2012</p>Anne Rice is one of America&#39;s most read and celebrated authors.

It sounded as if a dozen express trains were about to hit the shed. I rolled over in my blanket, trying to get out of the way, and was aware of a blaze of orange, lighting up boxes and bits of old farm equipment and tackle. An ancient rusting tractor looked briefly like an overgrown insect.<br> <br>&#x201c;What was that, Laurie?&#x201d; Andy asked. I could see him sitting up, between me and the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Both light and sound faded and died. A dog started barking&#x2014;deep-throated, a Labrador maybe. I got up and walked to the window, banging my shin on something in the dark. It was dark outside, too, moon and stars hidden by cloud. A light came on in the farmhouse, which was a couple of hundred meters away, just below the ridge.<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not raining. What was it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t someone at the camp say something about an artillery range on the moor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nowhere near here, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever they were firing could have gone astray.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rubbing my shin, I said, &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t sound like a shell. And a shell wouldn&#x2019;t produce fireworks like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A rocket, maybe.&#x201d; He yawned loudly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all quiet now, anyway. No sweat. Go to sleep. We&#x2019;ve a long trek in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stood by the window for a while. Eventually the light in the house went out: the farmer presumably took the same view as Andy. In the pitch black I felt my way to the pile of straw which served as a bed. This was less fun than it had seemed the previous evening; there was little protection from the hardness of the earth floor, and once awake I knew all about the aches in my muscles.<br> <br>Andy was already asleep. I blamed him for our being here&#x2014;for volunteering us into the orienteering expedition in the first place, and then for insisting on a left fork which had taken us miles out of our way. It had looked as though we would have to spend the night on the moor, but we&#x2019;d come across this isolated farm as dusk was thickening. The rules were not to ask for help, so we&#x2019;d settled down in the shed.<br> <br>I thought my aches, and resenting Andy, would keep me awake, but I was dead tired. We had set out early from summer camp, and it had been a long day&#x2019;s slog. Drifting into sleep again, I was half aware of another explosion, but it was a distant one, and I was too weary really to wake up&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t even be sure I wasn&#x2019;t dreaming.<br> <br>&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;<br> <br>Andy woke me with the gray light of dawn filtering in. He said, &#x201c;Listen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen!&#x201d;<br> <br>I struggled into wakefulness. The noise was coming from the direction of the farmhouse, but further away, a succession of loud thumpings, heavy and mechanical.<br> <br>&#x201c;Farm machinery?&#x201d; I suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Listening more carefully, I didn&#x2019;t either. The thumps came at intervals of a second or less, and they were getting nearer. There was even a sensation of the ground shaking under me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something heading this way,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;Something big, by the sound of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>We crowded together at the small window of the shed. The sun hadn&#x2019;t risen, but to the east the farmhouse was outlined against a pearly sky. Smoke from a chimney rose almost straight: farmers were early risers. It looked like a good day for the trek back to camp. Then I saw what was coming into view on the other side of the house.<br> <br>The top appeared first, an enormous gray-green hemispherical capsule, flat side down, which seemed to be floating ponderously in midair. But it wasn&#x2019;t floating: a weird stiltlike leg moved in a vast arc across the sky and planted itself just to the right of the farmhouse. As it crashed down a second leg appeared, passing over the house and landing between it and the shed. I could see a third leg, too, which if it followed suit would come to ground close to us, if not on top of us. But at that point, it stopped. The gigantic object, more than twenty meters high, stood straddling the house.<br> <br>A band of bright green glassy panels ran horizontally along the side of the capsule. It produced an effect that was a cross between multiple staring eyes and a grinning mouth. It wasn&#x2019;t a pleasant grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s making a film.&#x201d; Andy&#x2019;s voice was unsteady. I turned to him and he looked as scared as I felt. &#x201c;That must be it. A science-fiction movie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So where are the cameras?&#x201d; I felt my voice was coming out wrong, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;They probably have to get it into position first.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know whether he believed it. I didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Something was moving beneath the capsule, curling and twisting and stretching out. It was like an elephant&#x2019;s trunk, or a snake, except that it was silvery and metallic. It corkscrewed down towards the roof of the house and brushed lightly against it. Then it moved to the chimney stack and grasped it with a curling tip. Bricks sprayed like confetti, and we heard them crashing onto the slates.<br> <br>I was shivering. Inside the house a woman screamed. A door at the back burst open, and a man in shirt and trousers came out. He stared up at the machine looming above him and started running. Immediately a second tentacle uncurled, this time fast and purposeful. The tip caught him before he&#x2019;d gone ten meters, fastened round his waist, and plucked him from the ground. He was screaming, too, now.<br> <br>The tentacle lifted him up in front of the row of panels, and his screams turned to muffled groaning. After a few moments the tentacle twisted back on itself. A lenslike opening appeared at the base of the capsule; it carried him towards it and thrust him through. I thought of someone holding a morsel of food on a fork before popping it into his mouth, and felt sick.<br> <br>His groans ended as the tentacle withdrew, and the opening closed. The woman in the house had also become quiet; but the silence was even more frightening. Resting on its spindly legs, the machine had the look of an insect digesting its prey. I remembered my glimpse of the derelict tractor in the night; this insect was as tall as King Kong.<br> <br>For what seemed a long time, nothing happened. The thing didn&#x2019;t stir, and there was no sound or movement from the house. All was still; not even a bird chirped. The tentacle hovered in midair, motionless and rigid.<br> <br>When, after a minute or so, the tentacle did move, it raised itself higher, as though making a salute. For a second or two it hung in the air, before slamming down violently against the roof. Slates scattered, and rafters showed through a gaping hole. The woman started to shriek again.<br> <br>Methodically the tentacle smashed the house, and as methodically picked over the ruins, like a scavenger going through a garbage can. The shrieking stopped, leaving just the din of demolition. A second tentacle set to work alongside the first, and a third joined them.<br> <br>They probed deep into the rubble, lifting things up to the level of the panels. Most of what was picked up was dropped or tossed aside&#x2014;chairs, a sideboard, a double bed, a bathtub dangling the metal pipes from which it had been ripped. A few were taken inside: I noticed an electric kettle and a television set.<br> <br>At last it was over, and dust settled as the tentacles retracted under the capsule.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think we ought to get away from here,&#x201d; Andy said. His voice was so low I could hardly hear him.<br> <br>&#x201c;How far do you think it can see?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. But if we dodge out quickly, and get round the back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I gripped his arm. Something was moving at the base of the rubble that had been the farmhouse: a black dog wriggled free and started running across the farmyard. It covered about ten meters before a tentacle arrowed towards it. The dog was lifted, howling, in front of the panels, and held there. I thought it was going to be taken inside, as the man had been; instead the tentacle flicked it away. Briefly the dog was a black blur against the dawn light, then a crumpled silent heap.<br> <br>The sick feeling was back, and one of my legs was trembling. I thought of my first sight of the Eiffel Tower, the summer my mother left and Ilse came to live with us&#x2014;and my panicky feeling over the way it stretched so far up into the sky. This was as if the Eiffel Tower had moved&#x2014;had smashed a house to bits and swallowed up a man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tossed a dog to its death the way you might throw away an apple core.<br> <br>Time passed more draggingly than I ever remembered. I looked at my watch, and the display read 05:56. I looked again after what seemed like half an hour, and it said 05:58. The sky was getting lighter and there was first a point of gold, then a sliver, finally a disk of sun beyond the ruins of the house. I looked at my watch again. It was 06:07.<br> <br>Andy said, &#x201c;Look!&#x201d;<br> <br>The legs hadn&#x2019;t moved but the capsule was tilting upwards and beginning a slow rotation. The row of panels was moving to the left. Soon we might be out of the field of vision and have a chance of sneaking away. But as the rotation continued, a second row of panels came into view. It could see all round.<br> <br>When it had traversed a hundred and eighty degrees, the rotation stopped. After that, nothing happened. The monster just stayed there, fixed, as leaden minutes crawled by.<br> <br>The first plane came over soon after eight. A fighter made two runs, east to west and then west to east at a lower level. The thing didn&#x2019;t move. A quarter of an hour later a helicopter circled round, taking photographs, probably. It was nearly midday before the armored brigade arrived. Tanks and other tracked vehicles drew up on open farmland, and, in the bit of the farm lane in view, we could see an important-looking car and some trucks, including a TV van, all keeping a careful distance.<br> <br>After that, nothing happened for another long time. We learned later this was the period in which our side was attempting to make radio contact, trying different frequencies without result. Andy got impatient, and again suggested making a run for it, towards the tanks.<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;The fact it hasn&#x2019;t moved doesn&#x2019;t mean it won&#x2019;t. Remember the dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do. It might also decide to smash this hut.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if we run, and it starts something and the army starts something back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we&#x2019;re likely to catch it from both sides.&#x201d;<br> <br>He reluctantly accepted that. &#x201c;Why hasn&#x2019;t the army done something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think they ought to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, not just sit there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose they don&#x2019;t want to rush things.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I broke off as an engine started up, followed by a rumble of tracks. We ran to the window. A single tank was moving forward. It had a pole attached to its turret, and a white flag fluttering from the pole.<br> <br>The tank lurched across the field and stopped almost directly beneath the capsule. The engine switched off, and I heard a sparrow chirruping outside the shed. Then, unexpectedly, there was a burst of classical music.<br> <br>I asked, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s that coming from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From the tank, I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they want to demonstrate that we&#x2019;re civilized, not barbarians. It&#x2019;s that bit from a Beethoven symphony, isn&#x2019;t it&#x2014;the one that&#x2019;s sung as a European anthem?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Andy pointed. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d;<br> <br>The machine was showing signs of movement. Beneath the capsule a tentacle uncurled. It extended down towards the tank and began waving gently.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it doing?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s keeping time.&#x201d;<br> <br>The weird thing was, he was right; it was moving in rhythm with the music. A second tentacle emerged, dipped, and brushed against the turret. As though it were getting the hang of things, the first tentacle started moving faster, in a more positive beat. The second felt its way round the tank from front to rear, then made a second approach from the side, moving over it and probing underneath. The tip dug down, rocking the tank slightly, and reemerged to complete an embrace. The tank rocked more violently as it was lifted, at first just clear of the ground, then sharply upward.<br> <br>Abruptly the music gave way to the stridence of machine-gun fire. Tracer bullets flamed against the sky. The tank rose in the tentacle&#x2019;s grip until it was level with the panels. It hung there, spitting out sparks.<br> <br>But pointlessly; at that angle the tracers were scouring empty sky. And they stopped abruptly, as the tentacle tightened its grip; armorplate crumpled like tinfoil. For two or three seconds it squeezed the tank, before uncurling and letting it drop. The tank fell like a stone, landing on its nose and balancing for an instant before toppling over. There was a furrow along the side where it had been compressed to less than half its original width.<br> <br>Andy said, &#x201c;That was a Challenger.&#x201d; He sounded shaken, but not as shaken as I felt. I could still see that terrible careless squeeze, the tank dropped like a toffee paper.<br> <br>When I looked out again, one of the tentacles had retracted, but the other was waving still, and still in the rhythm it had picked up from the music. I wanted to run&#x2014;somewhere, anywhere, not caring what came next&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t move a muscle. I wondered if anyone in the tank had survived. I didn&#x2019;t see how they could have.<br> <br>Then, unexpectedly and shatteringly, there was a roar of aircraft as the fighter-bombers, which had been on standby, whooshed in from the south, launching rockets as they came. Of the six they fired, two scored hits. I saw the long spindly legs shatter, the capsule tilt and sway and crash. It landed between the ruins of the farmhouse and the wrecked tank, with an impact that shook the shed.<br> <br>I could hardly believe how quickly it was over&#x2014;and how completely. But there was the capsule lying on its side, with broken bits of leg sticking out. As we stared, a second wave of fighter-bombers swooped in, pulverizing the remains.</p><h2>Alien Sex: 19 Tales by the Masters of Science Fiction and Dark Fantasy (Roc Science Fiction)</h2><p>Nineteen erotic tales of love and aliens feature the writings of such popular authors as Harlan Ellison, Pat Murphy, Larry Niven, Connie Willis, Philip Jose+a7 Farmer, and Lewis Shiner.

In a terrible twist of fate, Moore himself was kidnapped and subsequently held captive by Somali pirates. Subjected to conditions that break even the strongest spirits&#x2014;physical injury, starvation, isolation, terror&#x2014;Moore&#x2019;s survival is a testament to his indomitable strength of mind. In September 2014, after 977 days, he walked free when his ransom was put together by the help of several US and German institutions, friends, colleagues, and his strong-willed mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Moore&#x2019;s own struggle is only part of the story: <em>The Desert and the Sea</em>&nbsp;falls at the intersection of reportage, memoir, and history. Caught between Muslim pirates, the looming threat of Al-Shabaab, and the rise of ISIS,&nbsp;Moore observes the worlds that surrounded him&#x2014;the economics and history of piracy; the effects of post-colonialism; the politics of hostage negotiation and ransom; while also conjuring the various faces of Islam&#x2014;and places his ordeal in the context of the larger political and historical issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A sort of <em>Catch-22</em> meets <em>Black Hawk Down, The Desert and the Sea</em>&nbsp;is written with dark humor, candor, and a journalist&#x2019;s clinical distance and eye for detail. Moore offers an intimate and otherwise inaccessible view of life as we cannot fathom it, brilliantly weaving his own experience as a hostage with the social, economic, religious, and political factors creating it.&nbsp;<em>The Desert and the Sea</em>&nbsp;is wildly compelling and a book that will take its place next to titles like&nbsp;<em>Den of Lions</em> and <em>Even Silence Has an End.</em></p></p><p><p><strong>With echoes of <em>Catch-22</em> and<em> Black Hawk Down</em>, author and former hostage Michael Scott Moore masterfully walks a fine line between personal narrative and journalistic distance in this page-turning and novelistic account of 977 days held captive by Somali pirates.</strong></p><p>Moore set off for Somalia in January 2012 after reporting on a historic trial of ten Somali pirates in Germany. He went with an open mind and a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. He knew the stories of poor fishermen whose livelihoods were threatened by international fishing vessels; he sympathized with the legacies of colonialism. Near the end of his trip, however, a gang of pirates captured him and demanded a ransom of twenty million dollars. Moore would be stuck in Somalia for more than two and a half years, shifted from camps in the desert bush to barren prison houses, and&#x2014;for several months&#x2014;he was held on a hijacked tuna vessel, where he would make friends with a crew of hostage fishermen. </p><p>As the only Western journalist to witness everyday life on a ship captured by Somali pirates, Moore recounts his dizzying ordeal as a rich and surprising story of survival. After a daring but desperate attempt to escape, he struggles with murderous fantasies as well as thoughts of suicide. Some of his guards&#x2014;happy to have an American to taunt&#x2014;suggest his long captivity is payback for the Battle of Mogadishu, the basis for the book <em>Black Hawk Down</em>, more than two decades before.</p><p>In the face of threats to kill him, or sell him to al-Shabaab, Moore maintains his humanity and his sardonic wit. He relates his captivity with calm detachment, brilliantly weaving his own experience as a hostage with the religious and political factors behind Somali piracy. His wide-ranging narrative brings us into the destitute lives of his guards, as well as memories of his father&#x2019;s self-destruction. <em>The Desert and the Sea</em> falls at the intersection of reportage, memoir, and history, and it will take its place next to titles such as <em>An Evil Cradling</em> and <em>Even Silence Has an End</em>.</p><p><strong>Michael Scott Moore</strong> is an accomplished author and journalist, a California native and a longtime resident of Berlin.

Although the Florentines painter Giotto (1266-1337) was known as a master of design and composition, he submitted only a circle drawn freehand, the famous "0 of Giotto." Yet he was awarded the commission. Why? What's so impressive about a simple circle? </p><p>Give a young child a crayon and paper and observe what he draws. At the earliest ages children scrawl lines and zigzags. There comes a time when they discover that a line's end can meet its beginning, and they take delight in the loop. It continues endlessly around and creates an inside separate from an outside. Eventually, they come upon the circle. The circle brings the loop to perfection, so round in every direction. Children love to trace circular objects like cups and cans to achieve the fascinating perfection so hard for a young hand to draw. </p><p>The discovery and appreciation of the circle is our early glimpse into the wholeness, unity, and divine order of the universe. Some psychologists say that the discovery of the circle arrives as the child discovers the self and distinguishes himself from another. Even as adults our attention remains hypnotically drawn to circles, toward their centers, in objects we create and those we see. We draw circles and they draw us. </p><p>Looking at a circle is like looking into a mirror. We create and respond irresistibly to circles, cylinders, and spheres because we recognize ourselves in them. The message of the shape bypasses our conscious mental circuitry and speaks directly to the quiet intelligence of our deepest being. The circle is a reflection of the world's--and our own--deep perfection, unity, design excellence, wholeness, and divine nature. </p><p>To ancient mathematical philosophers, the circle symbolized the number one. They knew it as the source of all subsequent shapes, the womb in which all geometric patterns develop. The Greek term for the principles represented by the circle was Monad, from the root <i>menein,</i> "to be stable," and <i>monas,</i> or "Oneness." In the alphanumeric correspondences of the Greeks, the letters of the word <i>monas</i> add up to 361. The system allows a difference of one, so the word for "oneness" becomes 360, not coincidentally, as that is also the number of degrees around a full circle. Ancient mathematical philosophers referred to the Monad as The First, The Seed, The Essence, The Builder, The Foundation, The SpaceProducer and, most dramatic, The Immutable Truth and Destiny. It was also called Atlas because like the Titan upholding the heavens it supports, it connects and separates the numbers it produces. </p><p>The ancient philosophers conceived that the Monad breathes in the void and creates all subsequent numbers (111111111 X 111111111 = 12345678987654321). Numbers only express different qualities of the Monad. The ancients didn't consider unity to be a "number" but rather a parent of numbers. They noted that unity exists in all things yet remains inapparent. They saw the relation of the Monad to all numbers in a metaphor of simple arithmetic: any number when multiplied by unity remains itself (3 X 1 = 3). The same 5 is true when unity divides into any number (5/1 = 5). Unity always preserves the identity of all it encounters. We might say that "one" waits quietly within each form without stirring, motionless, never mingling yet supporting all. The Monad is the universe's common denominator. The ancient Gnostics called it the "silence force." The universe was carved of this primeval silence. Everything strives in one way or another toward unity. </p><p>There's more to a circle than just a curved line. It's a wonderful first glyph of nature's alphabet. Every circle is identical. They only differ in size. Each circle you see or create is a profound statement about the transcendental nature of the uni-verse. Expanding from the "nowhere" of its dimensionless center to the infinitely many points of its circumference, a circle implies the mysterious generation from nothing to everything. Its radius and circumference are never both measurable at the same time in similar units due to their mutual relation to the transcendental value known as "pi" = 3.1415926 . . . When either the radius or circumference is measurable in whole, rational units, the other is an endless, irrational decimal. Thus, a circle represents the limited and unlimited in one body. </p><p>Our deepest awareness, the power that motivates all awareness, which we can call the "Power to Be Conscious," of which we are not ordinarily cognizant, recognizes its own transcendental nature in the geometry of the circle. For this reason the circle has been a universal symbol of an ideal perfection and divine state that always exists around and within us whether we acknowledge it or not. Religious art has traditionally turned to the circle to symbolize thisstate of divinity as "heaven," "paradise," "eternity," and"enlightenment."</p><p>Giotto's perfectly drawn circle communicated this universal ideal. </p><p><b>Important Tips on Using the Geometer's Tools</b></p><p>Before we use the three classic tools of the geometer, here are some points you should consider: </p><p>1. These three tools--compass, straightedge, and pencil--are ancient, found in various forms in most cultures. Used by artists, architects, and craftspeople, they are both practical and symbolic. </p><p>2. Whether you use a metal compass or a string tied to a stick in the earth, these tools represent divine attributes. Treat them with respect. </p><p>3. Do nothing unconsciously. Be aware of each action you perform with them. No act in a geometric construction is trivial or without profound symbolism and correspondence to the world's creating process. </p><p>4. Don't erase mistakes. Just as we cannot undo life's missteps, leave all marks where you make them and live with them until you can do the construction differently.</p></p><h2>Bible Curriculum - Grade 7 Student Workbook - Walking with God and His People (Walking With God and His People: Grade 7, Grade 7)</h2><p>In the Grade 7 curriculum, a thematic approach replaces the chronological approach employed in the earlier grades. Concentrating on the Old Testament, the unit focuses on such topics as God&#39;s covenant and his promise of a Savior. The unit on the feasts of Israel helps students make connections between the feasts and the work of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The unit on Job and Ecclesiastes give students an opportunity to study two books of the Bible that were not presented in the previous grades. Studying Proverbs gives students practical guidelines for how they are to live as God&#39;s children, and walking with the prophets give students a personalized look at God&#39;s characteristics and the promises he made to Israel. In the unit on prayer, students learn more about God&#39;s gift of prayer, and how to use it to build their relationships with God. The final unit on literary genres was developed to assist students as they read Scripture. The patterns and features of the literary techniques in the Bible will add another dimension to the students&#39; Biblical understanding.

W. Boreham on C. H. Spurgeon</h2><p>F. W. Boreham writes, &#34;A king-maker occupies a more exalted eminence than a king. And in that (Victorian) age of crisis and transformation there were many kingly spirits who gratefully confessed that, but for Mr. Spurgeon&#39;s ministry -- in public or in private -- their own contribution to the nations&#39; development would have been negligble.&#34; The complete foreword, written by Boreham for a friend&#39;s book, and from which the preceding is an extract, opens this book which gives tribute to C. H. Spurgeon. There is some redundancy in Boreham&#39;s three sermons, one lecture and an essay, but the portrait he paints in words of Spurgeon more than makes up for any repetition. A preface by Geoff Pound and two introductory essays about Spurgeon and his college by Steve Miller, a Harvest House editor that has studied him, provides context for a book that is not only biographical but inspiring. Spurgeon&#39;s Christ-centered focus and passion for souls are invigorating. The total page count is 92 (23 Roman numeral pages followed by 69 numbered pages). If you need refreshing, get to know this giant of a man through the eyes of F. W. Boreham and a few admirers of these two men.

He was educated and was later a pupil-teacher at Grosvenor United School, Tunbridge Wells. In December 1884 he became junior clerk with a local brickworks, where, in a locomotive accident, he lost his right foot, necessitating the life-long use of a stick. Late in 1887 he went to work as a clerk in London, becoming increasingly involved in church, debating and writing activities. Although his family was Anglican, he was baptized at Stockwell Old Baptist Church in 1890; he preached from pavement and pulpit and published &#34;Won to Glory&#34; in 1891. He was admitted to Spurgeon&#39;s College, London, in August 1892, serving as a student-minister at Theydon Bois, Essex, where he met Estella Maud Mary Cottee. In 1894 Boreham was called to the Scottish community at Mosgiel near Dunedin in New Zealand, and was inducted on March 17, 1895. Stella, then 18, followed to marry him at Kaiapoi on April 13, 1896. Boreham became president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand in 1902, and published &#34;The Whisper of God and Other Sermons.&#34; He wrote editorials for the Otago Daily Times, contributed to theological journals and, as a keen temperance advocate, participated in liquor polls in 1905 and 1907. In June 1906 Boreham was called to the Baptist Tabernacle, Hobart. He edited the Southern Baptist and later the weekly Australian Baptist and in 1910 became president of the Tasmanian Baptist Union. His &#34;George Augustus Selwyn&#34; was published in 1911. He wrote a biographical series for the Hobart Mercury, which in 40 years covered 2000 persons; from 1912-1959 he contributed 2500 editorials to the Mercury and the Melbourne Age. Boreham&#39;s 80 publications, including religious works, homiletic essays and novels, sold over one million copies. &#34;Throughout his life F. W. Boreham wrote and refined his stories in order to master the difficult art of telling a story well. Such diligence was rewarded as Dr. Boreham became recognized as one of the leading Christian preachers and writers in the first half of the twentieth century. In the second half of the last century, well-known preachers such as Billy Graham, Ravi Zacharias (USA) and Gordon Moyes (Australia) have frequently expressed their indebtedness to Boreham&#39;s writings&#34; (Dr. Geoff Pound).</p><h2>New Lovecraft Circle</h2><p>Used.
